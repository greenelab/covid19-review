## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China about 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
On April 4, 2020, the WHO reported that the global number of confirmed cases had surpassed one million [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200404-sitrep-75-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=99251b2b_4].
{{csse_deaths}} COVID-19 deaths had been reported worldwide as of {{csse_date_pretty}} (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).

Some review articles on aspects of COVID-19 have already been published and may be of great usefulness.
These have included reviews on the disease epidemiology [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008], immunological response [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], and pharmacological treatments [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6019].
[@doi:10.1038/d41591-020-00026-w] provides a brief narrative review of progress on some important ongoing COVID-19 research questions.
However, research on these topics is proceeding so quickly that any static review is likely to quickly become dated.

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
Further, we aim to amplify the true signal out of the vast noise produced by thousands of publications on the topic [@doi:10.1038/s42254-020-0175-7].
We will critique, sort and distill informative contents out of the overwhelming flood of information and help the larger scientific community to be better educated on this critical subject affecting all of us.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.


### About Coronaviruses

#### Classification:

Coronaviruses (CoVs; order *Nidovirales*, family *Coronaviridae*, subfamily *Orthocoronavirinae*) are enveloped viruses with some of the largest viral RNA genomes and helical capsids with the solar corona-like appearance [@isbn:0781760607].
All viruses in the *Nidovirales* order are characterized by: 1) enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genomes with a highly conserved genomic organization; 2) many non-structural genes by ribosomal shifting; 3) several unusual enzymatic activities encoded within the replicase-transcriptase polyprotein; and 4) 3' nested sub-genomic mRNAs [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1].
Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses.
Among them, alpha and beta coronaviruses infect mammalian species, gamma coronaviruses infect avian species and delta coronaviruses infect both mammalian and avian species [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
The viruses were initially subdivided into these genera based on antigenic relationships of the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins but are now divided by phylogenetic clustering.

Most coronaviruses are considered zoonotic viruses with little to no transmission observed in humans.
A major group of coronaviruses include human coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains associated with multiple respiratory diseases of varying severity, ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia, with severe symptoms mostly observed in immunocompromised individuals [@doi:10.1086/377612].
Approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans is attributable to four out of six previously known human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) that are globally circulating in the human population [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9;@doi:10.3390/diseases4030026].
In the past two decades, however, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have been identified, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) although both infections were confined to specific geographic regions [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81;@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The current pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an acute and rapidly spreading global health crisis with symptoms for reported cases ranging from mild to severe or fatal [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html] and including outcomes such as acute respiratory distress, acute lung injury and other pulmonary complications.
The possibility of asymptomatic cases is also being investigated.
The transmission and mortality rate estimations of COVID-19 remain to be determined.

[this section may be better as a figure panel + legend]
Phylogenetic analysis of a PCR amplicon fragment from five patients along with the total virus genome of 29.8 kilobases indicates that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the B lineage, also known as sarbecovirus.
The sarbecovirus lineage also includes the human SARS coronavirus [@doi:10/ggjs7j].


#### Virion, morphology, structure:
Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters ranging between 100 to 160nm.
The virion has a lipid envelope with spike (S) glycoproteins on the surface creating a distinctive "crown" shape, for which the family of viruses was named [@isbn:0781760607].


#### Genome structure and replication:
Coronavirus genomes are single-stranded non-segmented positive RNA (ssRNA+) that are 27 to 32kb in length.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome lies in the middle of this range at 29,903 bp in length [@doi:10/ggjr43].
Coronavirus genomes are comprised of a replicase gene that is 2/3 of the genome and the remaining 1/3 that encodes structural proteins including: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
There are additional accessory genes that are present depending on the strain.
The non-structural polypeptide is translated into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16, except Gammacoronaviruses that do not contain nsp1), which form replication machinery to synthesize viral RNA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25681].

Replication initiates with the binding of the virus to a host cell via the S protein.
The viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the host cytoplasm.
The replicase gene is translated and assembled into the viral replicase complex, which can synthesize dsRNA genome from the genomic ssRNA(+).
The dsRNA genome is then transcribed and replicated to create viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1; @url:https://viralzone.expasy.org/30?outline=all_by_species].

#### Transmission
In general, respiratory viruses like coronavirus can have multiple routes of person-to-person transmission including droplet transmission (i.e. inhalation for cough, sneeze), aerosol transmission (i.e. virus suspended in air), and contact transmission (i.e. contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes).
Other modes of transmission, such as through touching surfaces or objects and then touching mucous membranes, can also be investigated.
While existing evidence is insufficient to conclude which mode of transmission different coronaviruses use [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], simulations [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032867] and trace studies [@doi:10.3390/ijerph15122757] suggest that person-to-person transmission of coronaviruses is droplet based.
Other aspects of transmission to investigate are the relationship between infectiousness and virus shedding with disease period or symptoms and also the proportions of cases that are attributable to various types of transmission events, such as transmission between relatives, nosocomial transmissions, and other possible types of interactions.
Some information about these characteristics of transmission are available for the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-385885-6.00009-2; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
For SARS-CoV-2 it is still being investigated whether, in addition to being spread by people who show symptoms,  the virus can be transmitted by people who do not show symptoms [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html], such as during the pre-symptomatic stage of infection or in people with asymptomatic infections (a presentation which sometimes occurs in other infectious diseases but is still being investigated for SARS-CoV-2).

### SARS-CoV-2: Origin, Phylogenetics, and Evolution

#### Origin of SARS-CoV-2
The evolutionary origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are not yet fully understood.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have originated in a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts; however, current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

### COVID-19: Mechanisms and Presentation

#### Immunological Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans through the following possible mechanisms...[Summarize relevant mechanisms for cell entry & address evidence for/against ACE2 being important, etc.]

#### Clinical Presentation of COVID-19

A great diversity of symptom profiles has been observed for COVID-19, although a large study from Wuhan, China suggests fever and cough as the two most common symptoms on admission [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2002032].
One early retrospective study in China described the clinical presentations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 as including lower respiratory tract infection with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
This study [@doi:10/ggnxb3] noted that upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common, which suggests that the virus targets cells located in the lower respiratory tract.
However, recent data from the New York City region have shown variable rates of fever as a presenting symptom, leading to a less defined incidence across populations [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6775; @doi:10.1056/NEJMc2010419].
These differences are present when comparing both between institutions in similar locations and between different regions experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, leading to conflicting reports of the frequency of fever as a presenting symptom for patients upon hospital admission.
For example, even within New York City, one study [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6775] identified low oxygen saturation (<90% without the use of supplemental oxygen or ventilation support) in a significant percentage of patients on presentation, while another study [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2010419] reported cough, fever, and dyspnea as the most common presenting symptoms.
The variability of both which symptoms present and their severity makes it difficult for public health agencies to provide clear recommendations for citizens regarding what symptoms indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and should prompt isolation.

The significant range of individual outcomes observed has led to interest in which factors influence disease severity.
The reported hospitalization rates have been wide-ranging and appear to be influenced by age and location, with several underlying health conditions being disproportionately reported among hospitalized patients [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
Among patients who are admitted to the hospital, outcomes have generally been poor, with rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) upwards of 15% in both Wuhan, China and Italy [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2002032; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2648; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4031].
Several studies have also investigated which factors are likely to influence COVID-19 outcomes.
For example, a Chinese retrospective study [@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, as well as high levels of d-dimer.
Mortality might be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] reported that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days.
A later study reported radiographic findings such as ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in the lungs of many hospitalized patients, and most COVID-19 patients had lymphocytopenia, meaning they had low levels of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2002032].

COVID-19 can affect diverse body systems in addition to causing respiratory problems.
For example, COVID-19 can lead to acute kidney injury, especially in patients with severe respiratory symptoms or certain preexisting conditions [@doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006].
It can also cause neurological complications [@doi:10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031], potentially including stroke, seizures or meningitis [@doi:10.1002/jmv.26000; @doi:10.1002/ana.25807].

COVID-19 has also been associated with an increased incidence of large vessel stroke, particularly in patients under the age of 40 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2009787], and other thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [@doi:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013].
The mechanism behind these complications has been suggested to be related to coagulopathy with reports of antiphospholipid antibodies present [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2007575] and elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) elevated in deceased patients [@doi:10.1111/jth.14768].
Other viral infections have been associated with coagulation defects; notably SARS was also found to lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and was associated with both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [@doi:10.1002/jmv.23354].
A wide range of viral infections can effect the coagulation cascade.
The mechanism behind these insults has been suggested to be related to inflammation-induced increases in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) clotting protein, leading to a pro-coagulative state [@doi:10.1002/jmv.23354].
Individual outcomes have varied significantly, and reported hospitalization rates have been wide-ranging based on age and location, with various underlying health conditions being disproportionately reported [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
Outcomes in patients that are hospitalized have generally been poor, with rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) upwards of 15% in both Wuhan, China and Italy [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2002032; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2648; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4031].

#### Subpopulations of Special Concern  

The prevalence of different clinical features of COVID-19 infection differ in different areas of the world, presumably due to differential reporting and/or different levels of pre-existing risk factors [@doi:10.1007/s00592-020-01546-0].
In the context of the United States, persons infected with COVID-19 are more likely to require hospitalization if they are of male sex, older age, and/or of Black/African American background [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598]. [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1]
African Americans have also been reported to have disproportionate risk for kidney complications for COVID-19. [@doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006]  
The racial disparity may be due to a number of factors, including different vulnerability due to higher levels of a pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, to greater economic difficulties or more hazardous work, or to less access to or trust in the health care system.[@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006]
Less health care access could cause infections to be less likely to be diagnosed unless or until they are very severe. 
However, more research is needed into studying and and remediating these disparities. 
Long-term damage caused by chronic stress related to aversive social experiences [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.10.20097253] leading to cardiovascular risk [@doi:10.1007/s12170-013-0338-5] might be relevant but has not yet been researched in the specific case of COVID-19 disparities.
Disproportionate harm from COVID-19 has also been noted in other minorities, namely Latino/Hispanic communities and Native American / Alaskan Native tribal communities [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.8598; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m1483; @doi:10.1111/jrh.12451]. 
In Brazil, where the pandemic has also been severe, indigenous communities are likewise at special risk [@doi:10.1126/science.abc0073]. 

People living in certain geographical areas may be especially vulnerable to harm.
[@doi:10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502] provided observational evidence that localities in the United States which suffer from worse air pollution by fine particulate matter have also suffered more COVID-19 deaths per capita.
Although lack of individual-level exposure data and the impossibility of randomization make it difficult to elucidate the exact causal mechanism, this finding would be consistent with similar findings for all-cause mortality (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1803222115]).
The effects of the pandemic have the potential to cause major damage in low- to middle-income countries, including significant disruption to economic, food, educational and health care systems in addition to the direct effect of the virus [@doi:10.1126/science.abc0035; @doi:10/ggxs8q; @doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqaa171].

Though older populations are generally considered the most vulnerable, pediatric infections also occur.
[@doi:10.1001/jamapediatrs.2020.1467] reviewed studies on children infected with COVID-19 during the early months of COVID-19 in China.
Most of the children reviewed had mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion and/or runny nose or were asymptomatic.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea were occasionally reported.
Radiologic findings were not always mentioned, but when mentioned they included bronchial thickening, ground-glass opacities, and/or inflammatory lesions.
The results of COVID-19 infection can vary greatly among pediatric patients as well as adults.
In particular, some children have experienced a severe inflammatory syndrome after COVID-19 infection, similar in some respects to Kawasaki disease or to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome [@doi:10.1093/jpids/piaa069;@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.10369; @doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.117].
Heart failure can also occur [@doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.048360].

Genetic factors may also play a role in risk of respiratory failure for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2020283; @doi:10.1093/gerona/glaa131; @doi:10.1101/2020.06.16.155101], including possibly higher risk to individuals of blood group A and possibly lower risk to individuals of type O [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2020283].

Diabetes may increase the risk of lengthy hospitalization [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021] or of death [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021;@doi:10.1007/s00592-020-01546-0].  
[@doi:10.1111/dom.14057] and [@doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00124.2020] discuss possible ways in which COVID-19 and diabetes may interact.  
On a speculative basis, the mechanisms described in a report by [@doi:10.1007/s00592-009-0109-4] involving effects on the pancreas by the related SARS-CoV-1 virus, which could reportedly cause short-term diabetic symptoms, might perhaps be relevant here as well.

Obesity also appears to be associated with higher risk of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2, [@doi:10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262; @doi:10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042] although 
further research is needed regarding the exact mechanisms [@doi:10.1016/j.medj.2020.06.005].

Because different subpopulations may have somewhat different vulnerabilities, needs, and resources, we recommend that researchers publishing studies on diagnostics and therapeutics take extra care to be clear about the demographic and medical characteristics of their sample, in order to facilitate discussions of the degree to which results may generalize or differ in other settings.

#### Molecular Mechanisms of COVID-19

- How can we evaluate the human response to SARS-CoV-2 on a molecular level?
- What can omics technologies tell us about changes in the body following SARS-CoV-2 infection?

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to become the third coronavirus causing severe pneumonia in humans to emerge in the 21st century [@doi:10.1016/bs.aivir.2018.01.001]. 
Therefore, most of our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 infects cells is obtained from studies on previously identified coronaviruses. 
The entry of a coronavirus into a target cell is mediated by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to a specific cellular receptor and the subsequent priming/cleavage of the S protein by cellular proteases [@doi:10/cf8chz; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. 
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been identified as a prime receptor and a critical protease, respectively, facilitating SARS-CoV/CoV-2 entry into a target cell [@doi:10.1038/nature02145; @doi:10.1126/science.abb2507; @doi:10.1128/JVI.01542-10; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1128/JVI.02232-10]. 
This finding has led to a hypothesized role for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in determining which cells, tissues and organs are most likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Recent clinical investigations of COVID-19 patients have detected SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93% of specimens), sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), fibrobronchoscopy brush biopsies (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%) and blood (1%) [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786]. 
Two studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the urine specimens [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3204]; however, a third study identified four urine samples (out of 58) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids [@doi:10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774]. 
Respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death for COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1111/his.14134]. 
Besides major pulmonary damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage many other organ systems including the heart [@doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950], kidney [@doi:10.1038/s41585-020-0319-7; @doi:10.1186/s13054-020-02872-z], liver [@doi:10/ggpx6s], and gastrointestinal tract [@doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055; @doi:10.1111/1751-2980.12851]. 
As it becomes clearer that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage multiple organs, the scientific community is pursuing multiple avenues of investigation in order to build a consensus about how the virus affects the human body.
To quickly associate the clinical outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers are taking advantage of “omics” technologies to profile the expression of coronavirus entry factors across the tissues.

### Approaches to Understanding COVID-19

Scientific characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and of the COVID-19 disease it causes is critical to controlling the current pandemic.
Several broad areas of research interact with each other, offering different pieces of information critical to understanding the virus and disease.
A comprehensive understanding of the epidemic must unify basic scientific and medical research with public health and biotechnology.

#### Science & Medicine

Understanding how the virus functions and interacts with the host is foundational to understanding pathogenesis and disease progression and to identifying available and novel approaches to treatment.
Therefore, the fields of virology, immunology, and molecular biology are fundamental to characterizing SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
These topics can be approached using a range of techniques, including characterization of the host response from the cellular to systems level.
Contextualizing SARS-CoV-2 in relation to other viruses that infect humans and other animals can further serve to elucidate the reaction of the human host to viral exposure.
This information, when combined with an understanding of the biology of pharmaceutical and medical interventions, can guide new approaches to treatment.

#### Public Health

One necessary component of determining how to manage the outbreak is to understand epidemiological factors related to the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These can include characteristics such as when infected individuals are contagious, how the virus is transmitted between individuals, the range of symptoms associated with infection and/or contagiousness in different individuals, and how rapidly the virus propagates between individuals, etc.
The development of diagnostic tools is critical to this goal.
Accurate diagnoses on a large scale is necessary to collect the data needed to develop epidemiological models.
Other areas of public health that address resource availability, inequity, human behavior, and other components that influence people's exposure to pathogens and ability to manage illness will also be critical to mounting a global response to the pandemic.
Public health strategies to manage epidemics include anticipation and early detection of emerging diseases (aided by rapid development of diagnostics), containment (using strategies to test, trace and isolate such as widespread testing, contact tracing, quarantining and isolation), control and mitigation of spread (including social distancing), and elimination and eradication. 
An effective public health response requires response coordination, disease surveillance and intervention monitoring, risk communication and health education (including education about personal protective equipment and hand hygiene and containment of “infodemics” of false information), non-pharmaceutical measures to prevent and reduce transmission, and health interventions such as vaccines and other pharmaceuticals that can reduce transmission, curb morbidity and mortality, and mitigate the effects on health systems and other sectors of society [@url:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/managing-epidemics-interactive.pdf].
Currently, this manuscript focuses primarily on contextualizing epidemiological characteristics such as reproduction number and dynamics of transmission that intersect with the fundamental biology of the virus or the development of therapeutic and diagnostic technologies.

#### Biotechnology

##### Diagnostics

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.
The development of high-throughput, affordable methods for detecting active infections and sustained immunity will be critical to understanding and controlling the disease.

- What are approaches that allow us to detect current infection or past exposure for other viruses?
- What is sustained immunity and what are the indicators?

##### Therapeutics

The identification of interventions that can mitigate the effect of the virus on exposed and infected individuals is a significant research priority.
Some possible approaches include the identification of existing pharmaceuticals that reduce the severity of infection, either by reducing the virus' virulence (e.g., antivirals) or managing the most severe symptoms of infection.
Due to the long timeline for the development of novel pharmaceuticals, in most cases, research surrounding possible pharmaceutical interventions focuses on the identification and investigation of existing compounds whose mechanisms may be relevant to COVID-19.
Other foci of current research include the identification of antibodies produced by survivors of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.
Understanding the mechanisms describing host-virus interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2 are thus critical to identifying candidate therapeutics.

### Summary
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
We include information from both traditional peer-reviewed scientific literature and from preprints, which typically have not undergone peer review but have been critically evaluated by the scientists involved in this effort.
The goal of this manuscript is to present preliminary findings within the broader context of COVID-19 research and to identify the broad interpretations of new research, as well as limitations to interpretability.
