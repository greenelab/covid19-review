## Introduction {.page_break_before} 

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China about 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
On April 4, 2020, the WHO reported that the global number of confirmed cases had surpassed one million [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200404-sitrep-75-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=99251b2b_4].
At this time, over 92,000 deaths had been reported due to COVID-19 worldwide.

[Note: Maybe add a graph here, update as new reports come out.]

COVID-19 is caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, a family of RNA viruses known to cause respiratory and intestinal infections in humans and other species.
Infectious diseases of global concern have previously been associated with coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9]; however, neither of these reached pandemic status, owing to proper containment procedures (SARS) or intrinsic limitations in virus transmission (MERS).
Additionally, there are four endemic human coronaviruses that rarely progress beyond the mild symptoms associated with the common cold [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The precise identity of SARS-CoV-2 virus was unknown until approximately January 12, 2020, when Chinese officials released its genetic sequence to aid in worldwide efforts to diagnose the disease [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
As researchers worldwide work to characterize SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, information about the transmission and life cycle of the virus as well as the diagnosis and treatment of the disease is emerging rapidly.
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.

### About Coronaviruses

#### Classification:
Coronaviridae, commonly called Coronavirus, is a family of positive-sense RNA viruses [@isbn:0781760607]. 
Members of this family include the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which are two species, as well as SARS-CoV-2 [@url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronaviridae#Taxonomy].
Coronaviridae are classified into four main groups called alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses. 
Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are mainly found in mammals such as bats, rodents, civets, and humans, whereas gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses have their gene source from birds and are mainly found in birds.
Phylogenetic analysis of a PCR amplicon fragment from five patients in a family cluster who visited Wuhan, China along with the total virus genome of 29.8 kilobases indicates that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the B lineage, also known as sarbecovirus.
The sarbecovirus lineage also includes the human SARS coronavirus [@doi:10/ggjs7j]. 

#### Virion, morphology, structure:
Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters ranging between 100 to 160nm. 
The virion has a lipid envelope with spike (S) glycoproteins on the surface creating a distinctive "crown" shape, for which the family of viruses was named [@isbn:0781760607]. 

#### Genome structure and replication:
Coronavirus genomes are single-stranded non-segmented positive RNA (ssRNA+) that are 27 to 32kb in length. 
The SARS-CoV-2 genome lies in the middle of this range at 29,903 bp in length [@doi:10/ggjr43].
Coronavirus genomes are comprised of a replicase gene that is 2/3 of the genome and the remaining 1/3 that encodes structural proteins including: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 
There are additional accessory genes that are present depending on the strain. 
The non-structural polypeptide is translated into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16, except Gammacoronaviruses that do not contain nsp1), which form replication machinery to synthesize viral RNA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25681]. 

Replication initiates with the binding of the virus to a host cell via the S protein. 
The viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the host cytoplasm. 
The replicase gene is translated and assembled into the viral replicase complex, which can synthesize dsRNA genome from the genomic ssRNA(+).
The dsRNA genome is then transcribed and replicated to create viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1; @url:https://viralzone.expasy.org/30?outline=all_by_species].  

#### Transmission:
In general, respiratory viruses like coronavirus can have multiple routes of person-to-person transmission including droplet transmission (i.e. inhalation for cough, sneeze), aerosol transmission (i.e. virus suspended in air), and contact transmission (i.e. contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes). 
While there does not appear to be experimental evidence to conclude which mode of transmission different coronaviruses use [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], it is suggested that the coronavirus person-to-person transmission is droplet-based using simulations [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032867] and trace studies[@doi:10.3390/ijerph15122757].

### Origin of SARS-CoV-2 
[MERS and SARS? Where to put this?]
[Specifically about SARS-CoV-2/COVID19?]
The origin of the SARS-CoV-19 virus is not yet fully understood.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-19 is unlikely to have originated from a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].
Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-19 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-19 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts, however current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

### Disease (COVID19)

#### Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans through the following possible mechanisms...[Summarize relevant mechanisms for cell entry & address evidence for/against ACE2 being important]

#### Symptoms

*Presentation of COVID-19:* 
Information is rapidly becoming available about the wide range of symptoms that can be associated with COVID-19 as well as the range of symptom severity, onset from exposure, and possible risk or protective factors...

In a retrospective sample of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan observed during December 2019 and January 2020, [@doi:10/ggnxb3] described the clinical features of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 including lower respiratory tract infection with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. 
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] noted that upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common, which suggests that the virus targets cells located in the lower respiratory tract. 
Recent reports suggest that symptoms of infection by SARS-CoV-2 can vary greatly, making it difficult for public health agencies to provide clear recommendations for citizens regarding what symptoms indicate infection and should prompt isolation. 
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] also found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, as well as high levels of d-dimer. 
Mortality also appeared to be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
They also found that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days.

#### Vaccines for Viruses: Strategies for and challenges to development

Generally, the first step in producing a vaccine is characterizing the target.
The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was released to the world on January 11, 2020, which launched an intense global effort to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and vaccine developers to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of April 8, 2020, there are 115 vaccine candidates to prevent COVID-19, of which 78 were active. 
Of the 78 active vaccine programs, 73 were categorized as in the preclinical or exploratory stage (@doi:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5).

Historically, an H1N1 influenza vaccine was developed relatively efficiently, mainly because influenza-vaccine technology had already been developed and regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the experience producing and distributing the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into the commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. 

Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies. 
Experience in the field of oncology is encouraging COVID-19 vaccine developers to use next-generation approaches in vaccine development, which has led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs (@https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152). 
Diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus as well as inactivated virus approaches. 
Given these vast differences, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations (such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly etc).

#### Diagnostics and Therapeutics for Viruses

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.

Within therapeutics, some possible efforts include efforts to identify strategies for the management of symptoms as well as the development of antivirals...

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
