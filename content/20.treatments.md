## Therapeutics

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual’s immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b].
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.  

### Treatment of Symptoms

The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection differs dramatically between individuals.
Some are asymptomatic.
Others experience mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as cough, sore throat and fever, while the most severe cases of COVID-19 include severe complications including pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure and death [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html].
Vaccines are one avenue to mitigate harm from viral pathogens, but in the case of a rapidly growing pandemic the longer timeframe of vaccine development and distribution means that there can be a key for treatments that palliate symptoms to avoid the most severe outcomes from infection.

#### Tocilizumab

A recent study carried out on a sample of 191 adult COVID-19 in-patients at two Wuhan hospitals found that blood samples taken at admission contained significantly higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients who ultimately deceased compared to those who survived; average concentrations of IL-6 remained higher in the deceased group than the surviving group throughout hospitalization [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
This suggests that these individuals may be experiencing a "cytokine storm", which refers to an excessive inflammatory response.
IL-6 plays a key role in this response [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the family of interleukins, which are immune system regulators that are primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation.
Specifically, IL-6 promotes the differentiation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells [@pmid:9052836] and acts as a growth factor for hybridoma and myeloma cells [@pmid:8431556; @pmid:2104241].
In addition, IL-6 also induces the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into effector T-cell subsets [@doi:10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0022].
In this way interleukins regulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.
In this context, the observation of elevated IL-6 in patients who died may reflect an over-production of proinflammatory interleukins.

In a healthy situation the lung respiratory epithelium together with alveolar macrophages limits the activation of the immune system, ensuring homeostasis.
The introduction of the S-protein from SARS-CoV to mouse macrophages was found to increase production of IL-6 and TNF-α [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.007], and deceased SARS-CoV patients were found to have intermediate levels of IL-6, IL-1𝛽, and TNF-α expressed in a number of ACE2-expressing cell types sampled from the lung and bronchial tissues during autopsy [@doi:10.1002/path.2067].
However, other reports found the severe respiratory condition ARDS to be associated with elevated concentrations of IL-6 in BALF, but that concentrations of Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) and IL-1𝛽 decreased with the onset of ARDS [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
These cytokines enhance the pro-inflammatory reaction by increase acute-phase signaling, trafficking of immune cells to the site of primary infection, epithelial cell activation, and secondary cytokine production.
The acute phase response to infection results in the heavily damage of the endothelium of blood vessels, which disrupts the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory response [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
Thus, the holes generated allow not just for the passage of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of the infection but also the accumulation of liquids into the lungs, which is the ultimate cause of the death as per Acute Distress Respiratory Syndrome (ADRS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [@doi:10.1007/s00281-017-0629-x], also caused by the new coronavirus.
Recently Chinese and Italian doctors have found that the the Tocilizumab (actemra, by Roche), a drug commonly used in the rheumatoid arthritis, may palliate the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19.

##### Anticipated Mechanism

Human IL-6 is a glycoprotein of 26 kDa and it consists of 184 amino acids containing 2 potential N-glycosylation sites and four cysteine residues. IL-6 binds to its receptor either in the insoluble (IL-6R) and soluble (sIL-6R) form.
The receptor specificity determines the type of signaling. Specifically, the binding of IL-6 to the cell membrane receptor IL-6R gives rise to the "classical transduction of the signaling", while to binding to sIL-6R generate the so called "trans-signaling" [@doi:10.1016/j.cytogfr.2012.04.001; @doi:10.1042/bj3000281].
IL-6 signaling occurs through 3 independent pathways: the Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-STAT3 pathway, the Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) pathway and the Phosphoinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2016.00604].
The ultimate result of the IL-6 cascade is to direct transcriptional activity of various promoters of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TFN, including IL-6 own regulation through the activity of NF-κB [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2016.00604].
Particularly, IL-6 synthesis is tightly regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally . In this context, it has been shown that viral proteins can enhance transcription of the IL-6 gene, via strengthening the DNA-binding activity between several transciptional factors and IL-6 gene-cis-regulatory elements [@doi:10.2492/inflammregen.33.054].
Tocilizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds both to the insoluble and soluble receptor of IL-6, de facto inhibiting the IL-6 immune cascade.

##### Current Evidence

Chinese doctors have started a trial enrolling 188 patients of which 14 with severe lung disease have shown clear sings of improvements, according to their results [@url:https://www.genengnews.com/virology/coronavirus/genentech-launches-phase-iii-trial-of-actemra-as-coronavirus-treatment/].
Also, The AIFA (the Italian Drug Agency) approved the start of a new trial on March 19 recruiting patients at the initial stage of the infection [@url:https://www.univadis.co.uk/viewarticle/covid-19-italy-launches-an-independent-trial-on-tocilizumab-715741].
Together with these independent trials, Roche, also in collaboration with the FDA, will start a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial early April.
The trial will enroll 330 patients globally, which will be followed for 60 days upon use of the drug via injection to analyse its efficiency/safety (Biopharma-reporter.com).
However, previous studies on RA showed that in patients treated with TCZ the rate of incident infections in clinical practice patients was higher than the one observed during clinical trial [@doi:10.1093/rheumatology/ker223].
Also, RA patients with chronic hepatitis B (HB) infection showed high risk of HB virus reactivation upon TCZ administration in combination with other RA drugs [@doi:10.1111/1756-185X.13010].
These last findings highlight the need to search for a balance between impairing a harmful immune response, such as the one generated by the cytokine storm, and preventing the worsening of the clinical picture of the patients by potential new viral infections.
This aspect is probably crucial to be investigated further in the trials that are about to start.

Perhaps, the TCZ treatment would best suit patients with severely compromised lungs due to the COVID-19 infection and are therefore at greater risk of death, in order to stop the uncontrolled immune response before it’s too late.

### Small Molecule Drugs for Targeting SARS-CoV-2

The replication cycle of a virus within an epithelial host cell includes 6 basic steps which can be shortly summarised as follow: i) attachment of the virus to the host cell; ii) penetration by endocytosis; iii) uncoating, classically defined as the release of viral contents into the host cell; iv) biosynthesis, during which the viral genetic material enters the nucleus where it gets replicated; v) assembly, where viral proteins are translated and new viral particles are assembled; vi) release, when the new viruses are released into the extracellular environment [@isbn:978-1405136457].
Antiviral drugs do not kill the virus, rather they inhibit its amplification by impairing one of these steps.
Nowadays, many of these drugs act during the biosynthesis step in order to inhibit the virus’ genetic material replication.
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus.
Differently from a DNA virus, which can use the host enzymes to propagate itself, RNA viruses depends on their own polymerase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in order to be replicated [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25761].

#### Nucleotide Analogs
Removing this header for now, if we add additional nucleotide analogs, we can put it back
Why one might use nucleotide analogs.
#### Favipiravir

Favipiravir (T-705) was discovered by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. [@url:https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB12466#reference-A191688].
The drug was found to effective at blocking viral amplification in several Influenza subtypes as well as other RNA viruses (Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae) based on reduction in plaque formations [@doi:10.1128/AAC.46.4.977-981.2002] and viral replication in MDCK cells [@doi:10.1128/AAC.01051-06]. 
Furthermore, inoculation of mice with Favipiravir was shown to increase survivability. 
In 2014, the drug was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients infected with influenza that was resistant to conventional treatments, like neuraminidase inhibitors [@doi:10.2183/pjab.93.027].

##### Anticipated Mechanism
Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) acts as a purine and purine nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerase in a dose dependent manner across a range of RNA viruses, including Influenza virus [@doi:10.1128/AAC.49.3.981-986.2005; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01074-08; @doi:10.1128/AAC.00356-07; @doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.034; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01219-10]. 
Nucleotide/side are the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis.
Because of this, modifications to these nucleotides/sides can disrupt key processes including replication [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.04.004].
Evidence for T-705 inhibiting viral RNA polymerase are based on time-of-drug addition studies that found that viral loads were reduced with the addition of Favipiravir in early times post-infection [@doi:10.1128/AAC.49.3.981-986.2005; @doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.034; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01219-10].
Biochemical experiments showed that Favipiravir was recognized as a purine nucleoside analogue and incorporated into the viral RNA template. 
A single incorporation does not influence RNA transcription; however, multiple events of incorporation lead to the arrest of RNA synthesis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068347].
Evidence for T-705 inhibiting viral RNA polymerase are based on time-of-drug addition studies that found that viral loads were reduced with the addition of Favipiravir in early times post-infection [@doi:10.1128/AAC.49.3.981-986.2005; @doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.034; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01219-10].

##### Current Evidence
The effectiveness of Favipiravir for treating patients with COVID-19 is currently under investigation.
An open-label, nonrandomized, before-after controlled study was recently conducted [@doi:10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007].
The study included 80 COVID-19 patients (35 treated with Favipiravir, 45 control) from the isolation ward of the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases (The Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China.
The patients in the control group were treated with other anti-virals, such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir.
Treatment was applied on days 2-14; treatment stopped either when viral clearance was confirmed or at day 14.
The efficacy of the treatment was measured by 1) the time until viral clearance using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and 2) the improvement rate of chest computed tomography (CT) scans on day 14 after treatment.
The study found that Favipiravir increased the speed of recovery (measured as viral clearance from the patient by RT-PCR) to 4 days compared to 11 days using other antivirals such as lopinavir and ritonavir. 
Additionally, the lung CT scans of patients treated with Favipiravir showed significantly higher improvement rates (91%) on day 14 compared to control patients (62%).
However, there were adverse side effects in 4 (11%) Favipiravir-treated patients and 25 (56%) control patients.
The adverse side effects included: diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, rash, and liver and kidney injury.
Overall, despite the study reporting clinical improvement in Favipiravir-treated patients, due to some issues with study design, it cannot be determined whether treatment with Favipiravir had an effect or whether these patients would have recovered regardless of any treatment.
For example, the sample size is too small to give a powerful statistics.
The selection of patients did not take into consideration important factors such as previous clinical conditions or sex, and there was no age categorization.
The study was not randomized or blinded, and the baseline control group was another antiviral instead of a placebo.
Therefore, randomized controlled trials are still required.

##### Summary

Summarize the state of the antiviral approach.

#### Remdesivir

Remdesivir (GS-5734) was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola Virus Disease.
It does not have any FDA-approved use.
Although a clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo found some evidence of effectiveness against ebola, two antibody preparations were found to be more effective, and Remdesivir was not pursued [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1910993].

##### Anticipated Mechanism

Remdesivir is metabolized to GS-441524, an adenosine analog that inhibits a broad range of polymerases and then evades exonuclease repair causing chain termination [@doi:10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00221-18; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
Although it was developed against Ebola, it also inhibits the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV polymerase and inhibits coronavirus replication in cell culture assays with submicromolar IC50s [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653].
It also inhibits SARS-CoV-2, showing synergy with chloroquine _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].

##### Current Evidence

In addition to the previous work showing Remdesivir to be an effective treatment for viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cultured cells and animal models, a recent study found that administration of Remdesivir to non-human primate models resulted in 100% protection against infection by the Ebola virus.
Remdesivir has also been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human cell line sensitive to the virus [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].

The effectiveness of Remdesivir for treating patients with COVID-19 is currently under investigation.
Remdesivir has been used on some COVID-19 patients under compassionate use guidelines [@doi:10.1126/science.abb7243, @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2001191; @doi:10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896].
All were in late stages of COVID-19 infection, and these reports are inconclusive about the drug's efficacy.
Gilead Sciences, the maker of Remdesivir, led a recent publication that reported outcomes for compassionate use of the drug in 61 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19.
Here, 200mg of Remdesivir was administered intravenously on day 1, followed by a further 100mg/day for 9 days [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016].
There were significant issues with the study design or lack thereof.
There was no randomized control group.
The inclusion criteria were variable: some patients only required low doses of oxygen, others required ventilation.
The study included many sites, potentially with variable inclusion criteria and treatment protocols.
Patients analyzed had mixed demographics.
There was a short follow-up period of investigation.
Some patients worsened, some patients died, and eight were excluded from the analysis mainly due to missing post-baseline information, thus their health is unaccounted for.
Therefore, even though the study reported clinical improvement in 68% of the 53 patients ultimately evaluated, due to the significant issues with study design, it cannot be determined whether treatment with Remdesivir had an effect or whether these patients would have recovered regardless of treatment.
As a result, the study does not alter our understanding of the efficacy of Remdesivir in this setting, and randomized controlled trials are still required.
Remdesivir recently entered controlled clinical trials, and as of March 2020, there are six clinical trials underway to treat COVID-19 patients at both early and late stages of infection and in combinations with other drugs [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705; @url:https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-000936-23/FR; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252664; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656].

##### Summary

Remdesivir is a major drug candidate since it attacks the virus with high potency and known mechanism.
Moreover, one of the most successful therapies for viral diseases is to target the viral replication machinery, which are typically virally encoded polymerases.
Small molecule drugs targeting viral polymerases are the backbones of treatments for other viral diseases including HIV and Herpes.
Note that the HIV and Herpes polymerases are a reverse transcriptase and a DNA polymerase respectively, whereas SARS-CoV-2 encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, so most of the commonly used polymerase inhibitors are not likely to be active against SARS-CoV-2.
In clinical use, polymerase inhibitors show short term benefits for HIV patients but for long term benefits they must be part of combination regimens.
They are typically combined with protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and even other polymerase inhibitors.   

#### Protease Inhibitors

Several studies showed that viral proteases play an important role in the life cycle of (corona)viruses by modulating the cleavage of viral polyprotein precursors [@doi:10.2174/138161207780162971]. 
Several FDA-approved drugs target proteases like like Lopinavir and Ritonavir in HIV infection, and Simeprevir in hepatitis C virus infection.
In particular, serine protease inhibitors were suggested for the treatment of SARS and MERS viruses [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011].
Recently, a study [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052] suggested that camostat mesylate, an FDA-approved protease inhibitor (PI) could block the the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung cells in vitro.
However, to test the efficacy of PIs in patients, randomized clinical trials have to be conducted on patients and healthy volunteers.

##### N3
N3 is an inhibitor of Mpro, a 33.8-kDa SARS-CoV-2 protease that is involved in viral replication and transcription.

###### Anticipated Mechanism
N3 inhibits Mpro through binding to its substrate pocket.

##### Current Evidence

N3 was first designed computationally [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030324] to bind in the substrate binding pocket of the Mpro protease of SARS-like coronaviruses [@doi:10.1007/s13238-013-2841-3]. 
Consequently, the structure N3-bound SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has been solved [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y], which confirmed the computational prediction.
Finally, N3 reduced the viral load in samples taken from patients.

##### Summary

N3 is a computationally designed molecule that inhibits the viral transcription through inhibiting Mpro.
Although N3 is a strong inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, its safety and efficacy have to be tested in healthy volunteers and patients.

##### Ebselen
Ebselen identified as Mpro protease inhibitor.
It is currently investigated as an anti-oxidant drug [@doi:10.1007/s11033-014-3417-x].

###### Anticipated Mechanism
Ebselen inhibits Mpro through binding to its substrate pocket.

###### Current Evidence

After the design and confirmation of N3 as a highly potent Michael acceptor inhibitor and the identification of Mpro structure [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y; @doi:10.1126/science.abb3405], 10000 compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-Mpro activity.
The six leads that were identified were Ebselen, Disulfiram, Tideglusib, Carmofour, PX-12.
When the compounds were further assayed on patient viral samples, Ebselen had the strongest potency in reducing the viral load.
However, the authors cautioned that these compounds are likely promiscuous binders, which would diminish their therapeutic potential.

###### Summary

Ebselen is both a strong Mpro inhibitor and strong inhibitor of viral replication in vitro.
The reduction of the viral load after exposure to Ebselen was even larger than N3.
Ebselen is a very promising compound since its safety has been demonstrated in other indications. 
However, Ebselen is likely a false positive since it is a promiscuous compound that can have many targets [@doi:10.1039/c8cc04258f].
Therefore, compounds with higher specificity are required to effectively translate to clinical trials.

### Broad-Spectrum Pharmaceuticals

- Add some background on broad-spectrum pharmaceuticals

#### Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) are quinolones that have been widely used as anti-malarial and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in humans.
HCQ and CQ act through the same mechanism of action, but HCQ is regarded to be safer [@doi:10.1136/ard.2008.101766].
HCQ/CQ have been reported to have anti-viral effects, including in HIV-1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10/dh8phb; @doi:10.1128/AAC.03011-14; @doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
_In vitro_ studies of CQ use for SARS-CoV infection suggest anti-viral activity is due to inhibition of viral entry through elevation of endosomal pH and terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the cellular entry receptor [@doi:10.1186/1743-422X-2-69].
In vitro studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection show both HCQ and CQ to be effective in inhibiting viral replication, with HCQ being more potent [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237].
A case study of three COVID-19 patients reported presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in all three patients [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2007575].
Antiphospholipid antibodies are central to the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome. 
HCQ has been reported to be effective in treating Antiphospholipid Syndrome [@doi:10.1182/blood.V128.22.5023.5023; @doi:10.1016/j.autrev.2014.01.053; @doi:10.1182/asheducation-2016.1.714].

Thus, there is excitement about HCQ as a potential therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
This section will discuss current efforts on assessing the potential impact of HCQ in treating COVID-19.

##### Current Evidence

Gautret et al conducted a non-randomized, non-blinded, non-placebo clinical trial on 42 hospitalized patients comparing HCQ to standard care [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949].
This trial found patients who received HCQ showed higher rates of virological clearance by nasopharyngeal swab on Days 3-6 when compared to standard care.
This study also treated six patients with both HCQ + azithromycin and found this combination therapy to be more effective than HCQ alone.
This study showed design and analysis weaknesses that severely limit interpretability of results.
These weaknesses include: lack of randomization, lack of blinding, lack of placebo, lack of Intention-To-Treat analysis, lack of correction for sequential multiple comparisons, trial arms entirely confounded by hospital, false negatives in outcome measurements, lack of trial pre-registration, and small sample size.
Two of these weaknesses are due to inappropriate data analysis and can therefore be corrected post-hoc by recalculating p-values (lack of Intention-To-Treat analysis and multiple comparisons.)
However, all other weaknesses are fundamental design flaws and can not be corrected for.
Thus, conclusions cannot be generalized outside of the study.
Additionally, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the scientific organization that publishes _International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents_ where the article appeared, has announced that the article does not meet its expected standard for publications [@url:https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement], although it has not been officially retracted.
Because of the preliminary data presented in this study, the use of HCQ in COVID-19 treatment has subsequently been explored by other researchers.

A randomized, non-placebo trial of 62 COVID-19 patients at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University studied whether HCQ decreased time to fever break or time to cough relief when compared to standard care [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758].
This trial found HCQ decreased both average time to fever break and average time to cough relief, defined as mild or no cough.
However, this study also had flaws in trial design and analysis that prevent generalization of the results.
These weaknesses include: lack of placebo, lack of correction for multiple primary outcomes, inappropriate choice of outcomes, lack of sufficient detail to understand analysis, drastic disparities between pre-registration and published protocol, and small sample size.
The choice of outcomes may be inappropriate as both fevers and cough may break periodically without resolution of illness.
Additionally, for these outcomes, the authors report 23/62 patients did not have fever and 25/62 patients did not have cough at the start of the study - the authors fail to describe how these patients were included in a study assessing time to fever break and time to cough relief.
It is important to note here that the authors claim "neither the research performers nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignments."
This seems impossible in a non-placebo trial - at the very least, providers would know whether they were administering a medication or not, and this knowledge could lead to systematic differences in how care is given.
Correction for multiple primary outcomes can be adjusted post-hoc by recalculating p-values, but all other issues are design and statistical weaknesses that cannot be corrected for.
Additionally, the observation of drastic disparities between pre-registration and published protocol may be suggestive of p-hacking.
Conclusions cannot de generalized outside of the study, but the results support further investigation.

A randomized trial from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center of 30 COVID-19 patients studied whether HCQ increased rates of virological clearance by respiratory pharyngeal swab on Day 7 post-treatment compared to standard care [@doi:10/drbx].
This trial was published in Chinese with an abstract also in English.
Only the English abstract was read and interpreted.
The trial found HCQ showed comparable outcomes to standard care with regard to virological clearance rate, time to virological clearance, and time to body temperature normalization.
A known weakness is small sample size.
This problem suggests the study is underpowered to detect potentially useful differences and precludes interpretation of results.
Additionally, because only the abstract could be read, other design and analysis issues could be present.
Conclusions should be interpreted very cautiously.
However, these preliminary negative results do reiterate the need for further study.

A case study treated 11 consecutive patients with HCQ + azithromycin using the same dosing regime reported by Gautret et al [@doi:10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.006].
One patient died, two were transferred to the ICU, and one developed a prolonged QT interval leading to discontinuation of HCQ + azithromycin.
As in the Gautret et al study, the outcome measurement was virological clearance at Day 6 post-treatment by nasopharyngeal swabs.
Of the ten living patients on Day 6, eight of the patients remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Interpretation of conclusions are severely limited by lack of comparison group and small sample size.
However, these results stand in contrast to claims by Gautret et al that all six patients treated with HCQ + azithromycin tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by Day 6 post-treatment.
This case study illustrates the need for better and further investigation.

A Letter to the Editor was published in BioScience Trends claiming numerous clinical trials showed HCQ is superior to control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of COVID-19 pneumonia [@doi:10.5582/bst.2020.01047].
This Letter has been cited by numerous primary literature, review articles, and media alike [@doi:10.7150/ijbs.45498; @doi:10.7150/ijbs.45053].
Yet, this Letter's claims of clinical trials supporting HCQ use refer only to 15 pre-registration identifiers from the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.
When these identifiers are followed back to the registry, most trials claim they are not yet recruiting patients or are currently recruiting patients.
For all of these 15 identifiers, no data uploads or links to publications could be located on the pre-registrations.
At the very least, an inability to locate primary data means such claims cannot be verified.
Additionally, citation of unavailable sources cast doubt on policies and research based on the assumption that HCQ is effective in treating COVID-19.
A randomized, open-label, non-placebo trial of 150 COVID-19 patients was conducted in parallel in 16 government-designated COVID-19 centers in China to assess the safety and efficacy of HCQ [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.10.20060558].
The trial examined the efficacy of HCQ in conjunction with standard of care (SOC) compared to SOC alone in 150 infected patients assigned randomly to the two respective groups (75 per group). 
Most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in this cohort were mild to moderate (98%), and the average age of the patients was 46 years.
The primary endpoint of the study was the negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 in 28 days, and the investigators found no difference in this parameter between the groups.
The secondary endpoints were an amelioration of the symptoms of the disease such as axillary temperature ≤36.6°C, SpO2 >94% on room air, and disappearance of symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, and sore throat.
The median time to symptom alleviation was similar across different conditions (19 days in HCQ+SOC vs. 21 days in SOC).
However, the investigators reported an interesting finding revealed in _post hoc_ analysis: controlling for the administration of antivirals yielded an effect of HCQ on the alleviation of symptoms, with a reported hazard ratio of 8.83.
However, the 95% confidence interval of 1.09 to 71.3 suggests that this analysis may be underpowered and should be interpreted cautiously, as only 28 patients total (14 in each group) met this criterion.
Additionally, there was a non-significant trend towards a greater number of lymphocytes in the SOC+HCQ group compared to the SOC alone group (mean of 0.062 versus 0.008; p=0.57). 
Given the improvement in CRP levels and the possible improvement in lymphocyte count, the authors hypothesized that the addition of HCQ to the current SOC could decrease the inflammatory response and subsequently prevent multiorgan failure and death. 
Additionally, one of the key results of this trial was that the 30% of the patients receiving SOC+HCQ reported adverse outcomes as opposed to 8.8% of patients receiving only SOC. 
The most common adverse outcome in the SOC+HCQ group was diarrhea (10% vs. 0% in the SOC group, p=0.004). 

The study had a few limitations. 
One of the limitations of the study was that the cohort mostly consisted of patients with mild to moderate symptoms, and the average age of analyzed patients was 46.
This average may not be representative for COVID-19 patients because older age groups are known to be at higher risk.
Although the authors claimed that HCQ could have beneficial effects in hindering disease progression, multiorgan failure, and death in COVID-19, this finding cannot be extrapolated to older patients or severe cases based on the evidence they present.
Indeed, a larger sample needs to be tested to validate whether lymphocyte counts do increase in patients treated with SOC+HCQ; although the result in the present analysis appeared promising, it lacked statistical significance.
Additionally, in this study, SOC included the use of antivirals (Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Arbidol, Oseltamivir, Virazole, Entecavir, Ganciclovir, and Interferon alfa), which appeared to introduce confounding effects. 
Thus, to better assess the effects of HCQ, an alternate study design needs to be outlined where SOC does not involve the use of anti-virals.
In this trial, the samples used to test for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were collected from the upper respiratory tract, and the authors indicated that the use of upper respiratory samples may have introduced false negatives (e.g., [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786]); thus, the identification of biomarkers that can be collected non-invasively would be valuable to studies such as this one.
Another limitation of the study that the authors acknowledge was that the HCQ treatment began, on average, at a 16-day delay from the symptom onset.
A quicker treatment regimen with HCQ needs to be investigated to elucidate how the drug affects early disease management.
Overall, the study provides promising data, although all of the findings still need to be validated in independent population cohorts. 
Their safety analysis indicated that the adverse effects of administering HCQ to mild and moderate COVID-19 cases were manageable. 
Further investigation is necessary to confirm whether the drug indeed ameliorates symptoms and reduces inflammatory response.
##### Summary

In vitro evidence shows HCQ may be an effective therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. 
Multiple clinical studies have already been carried out to assess this possibility.
All current studies are low-quality and have small sample sizes.
Thus, interpretation is severely limited and must be done cautiously.
Additionally, disagreements between studies demonstrate there is controversy on the effectiveness of HCQ, as well as HCQ + azithromycin combination therapy.

This uncertainty is important to recognize clinically because HCQ-based treatments can lead to dangerous side effects like prolonged QT interval [@doi:10.1155/2016/4626279].
HCQ use for COVID-19 also leads to shortages for anti-malarial or anti-rheumatic use, where it has been definitively proven to be effective.
Further investigation of HCQ in large, rigorous, multi-center clinical trials is necessary.

#### Nutraceuticals

Considering the current pandemic, scientists and the medical community are scrambling to repurpose or discover novel host-directed therapies for which nutraceuticals hold some promise.
Nutraceuticals are classified as supplements with health benefits beyond their basic nutritional value designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of disease [@doi:10.1080/10408390902841529; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Nutraceuticals purported to boost the immune response, reduce immunopathology, exhibit antiviral activities or prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are being considered for their potential therapeutic value [@doi:10/ggkd3b].
A host of potential candidates have been highlighted in the literature that target various aspects of the COVID-19 viral pathology, while others are thought to prime the host immune system.
These candidates include vitamins and minerals along with extracts and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707].
Considerable evidence in vitro and in vivo suggests that nutraceuticals containing phycocyanobilin, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, selenium or phase 2 inductive nutraceuticals (e.g. ferulic acid, lipoic acid, or sulforaphane) can prevent or modulate RNA virus infections via amplification of the signaling activity of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and activation of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007]. 
While promising, further animal and human studies are required to assess the therapeutic potential of these various nutraceuticals against COVID-19. 

##### n-3 PUFA

Another potential nutraceutical that has exhibited beneficial effects against various viral infections is n-3 PUFA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
EPA and DHA intake can come from a diet high in fish intake or through dietary supplementation with fish oils or purified oils [@doi:10.3390/molecules22111964].

###### Potential Mechanisms

N-3 PUFA nutraceuticals can mediate inflammation and they have the capacity to modulate the adaptive immune response [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04374.x; @doi:10.3390/molecules22111964; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Another potential mechanism by which n-3 PUFA could exert beneficial effects against viral infections is by acting as precursor molecules for the biosynthesis of endogenous specialised proresolving mediators (SPM) like protectins and resolvins that actively resolve inflammation and infection [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.02.009]. 

###### Current Evidence

SPM have exhibited beneficial effects against a variety of lung infections including RNA viruses [@doi:10.1038/nri.2015.4].
Indeed, protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
Moreover, not all studies are in agreement that n-3 PUFA are effective against infections [@doi:10.3945/jn.109.108027]. 
Indeed, the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA against infections is dependent on the dosage, timing, and the specific pathogens responsible [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2016.10.001].  

###### Summary

However, the overall lack of human studies in this area means there is limited evidence as to whether these nutraceuticals could affect COVID-19 infection.  

##### Zinc Supplements

There is evidence that nutrient supplements may exhibit some benefit against RNA viral infections.
Zinc is a trace metal obtained from dietary sources or supplementation that is important for the maintenance of immune cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc supplements can be administered orally as a tablet or as a lozenge and they are available in many forms, such as zinc picolinate, zinc acetate, and zinc citrate.
Zinc is also available from dietary sources including meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, legumes, and dairy.

###### Potential Mechanisms

The role of zinc in immune function has been extensively reviewed [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc is an important signaling molecule and zinc levels can alter host defense systems. 
In inflammatory situations such as an infection, zinc can regulate leukocyte immune responses and it can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), thus altering cytokine production [@doi:10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.4180; @doi:10.1067/mlc.2001.118108]. 
In particular, zinc supplementation can increase natural killer cell levels, which are important cells for host defense against viral infections [@doi:10.1126/science.1198687; @doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].

###### Current Evidence

Adequate zinc intake has been associated with reduced incidence of infection [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837] and antiviral immunity [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmz013].
Similarly, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that administered zinc supplementation to elderly subjects over the course of a year found zinc deficiency to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection and that zinc deficiency could be prevented through supplementation [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837].
Clinical trial data supports the utility of zinc to diminish the duration and severity of symptoms associated with common colds when it is provided within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [@doi:10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz; @doi:10.2174/1874306401105010051].
In coronaviruses specifically, in vitro evidence demonstrates that the combination of zinc (Zn2+) and zinc ionophores (pyrithione) can interrupt the replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-GFP (a flourescently tagged SARS-CoV) and a variety of other RNA viruses [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.015].

###### Summary

While overall there is encouraging data for zinc supplementation against the common cold and viral infections, there is currently limited evidence to suggest zinc supplementation has any beneficial effects against the current novel COVID-19, thus further research is imperative.
However, it would be advisable to maintain a healthy diet to ensure an adequate zinc status to prevent the likelihood of an infection. 

##### Vitamin C

Vitamins B, C, D, and E have also been suggested as potential nutrient supplement interventions for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707; @doi:10.20944/preprints202003.0347.v1].
In particular vitamin C has been proposed as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent against COVID-19. 
Vitamin C can be obtained via dietary sources such as fruit and vegetable or via supplementation.  

###### Potential Mechanisms

Vitamin C plays a significant role in promoting immune function due to its effects on various immune cells.
Vitamin C affects inflammation by modulating cytokine production, decreasing histamine levels, enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes, increasing antibody levels, and protecting against the negative effects of reactive oxygen species amongst other effects [@doi:10.1155/2014/426740; @doi:10.1007/s00210-013-0880-1; @doi:10.3390/nu9111211]. 
During viral infections vitamin C is utilised as evinced by lower concentrations in leukocytes and lower concentrations of urinary vitamin C. 
Post-infection, these levels return to baseline ranges [@doi:10.1177/003693307301800102; @doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb29312.x; @doi:10/fd22sv; @doi:10.3390/nu9040339; @doi:10.1079/bjn19920004]. 

###### Current Evidence

A recent meta-analysis found consistent support for regular vitamin C supplementation reducing the duration of the common cold, but that supplementation with vitamin C (> 200 mg) failed to reduce the incidence of colds [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4].
Individual studies have found Vitamin C to reduce the susceptibility of patients to lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia [@doi:10.1097/00006454-199709000-00003].
Another meta-analysis has demonstrated in twelve trials that vitamin C supplementation reduced the length of stay of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) by 7.8% (95% CI: 4.2% to 11.2%; p = 0.00003).
Furthermore, high doses (1-3 g/day) significantly reduced the length of an ICU stay by 8.6% in six trials (p = 0.003).
Vitamin C also shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% in three trials in which patients required intervention for over 24 hours (95% CI 7.7% to 27%; p = 0.001) [@doi:10.3390/nu11040708].
Despite these findings, the CITRUS ALI study failed to show a benefit of a 96-hour infusion of vitamin C to treat ARDS, which is a severe complication of COVID-19 infection [@doi:10.1001/jama.2019.11825].
Nevertheless, a randomized placebo-controlled trial [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533] has begun in Wuhan, China to investigate the intravenous infusion of vitamin C to treat pneumonia in 140 severe COVID-19 infected patients. 
As summarized by Carr [@doi:10.1186/s13054-020-02851-4] the trial will not be completed until September 2020.
Another trial in Italy [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04323514] intends to deliver a 10 g infusion of vitamin C to 500 severe COVID-19 patients with pneumonia to assess in-hospital mortality over a 72 hr period as the primary outcome. 
The trial is currently recruiting and is due to run until March 2021.
We will not know how effective vitamin C is as a therapeutic for quite some time due to the length of both trials.
When completed, the trials will provide crucial evidence on the efficacy of vitamin C as a therapeutic for COVID-19 infection. 

###### Summary

Some evidence suggests that vitamin C supplementation can shorten the duration of a cold, reduce an individual's susceptibility to infections, and shorten a patient's stay in an ICU when administered at high doses.
We don't yet understand if these findings apply to COVID-19. 
There are ongoing trials in China and Italy that will inform our understanding of the therapeutic value of vitamin C supplementation for COVID-19.  


##### Vitamin D

In terms of other dietary supplements, vitamin D can modulate the adaptive and innate immune system and has been associated with various aspects of health. 
Vitamin D can be sourced through diet or supplementation, but it is mainly biosynthesized by the body on exposure to sunlight.

###### Potential Mechanisms

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755].
In particular, vitamin D deficient patients are at risk of developing acute respiratory infections [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017] and ARDS [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017]. 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the active form of vitamin D that is involved in adaptive and innate responses, whereby the vitamin D receptor is expressed in various immune cells and vitamin D is an immunomodulator of antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and T- and B-lymphocytes [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755; @doi:10.1016/j.coph.2010.04.001].
Due to its potential immunomodulating properties, vitamin D supplementation may be advantageous to maintain a healthy immune system. 

###### Current Evidence

A recent preprint postulated that an individual’s vitamin D status may significantly affect one’s risk of developing COVID-19. 
This hypothesis was derived from the fact that the current pandemic occurred in winter in Wuhan China when 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are at their lowest due to lack of sunlight, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, where it was nearing the end of the summer, the number of cases was low at that time coinciding with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [@doi:10.20944/preprints202003.0235.v2].
The authors suggest that people at risk of developing COVID-19 should increase their vitamin D3 intake to reach 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations above 40–60 ng/ml.
The authors also suggest supplementation of vitamin D to treat infected patients and to prevent infection in hospital staff.
While vitamin D is relatively inexpensive and safe to consume, caution is warranted when interpreting this review as it has yet to be determined whether vitamin D levels effect COVID-19 specifically. 
Likewise, it is assumed that COVID-19 may be seasonal, but there are multiple other factors at play that can affect vitamin D levels that need to be considered.
These factors include an individual’s nutritional status, their age, their occupation, skin pigmentation, potential comorbidities, and the variation of exposure to sunlight due to latitude amongst others [@doi:10.3390/nu7075111].   

###### Summary
  
Supplementation of vitamin D and maintaining a healthy diet for optimum vitamin D status warrants further investigation. 
This is particularly important considering ‘stay in place’ guidance has been implemented in many densely populated cities around the world.
This measure is likely to limit people’s exposure to sunlight and thus reduce endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, potentially weakening the immune system and increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. 

##### Nutraceutical Conclusions

Despite all the potential benefits of nutraceutical and dietary supplement interventions presented, currently there is a paucity of clinical evidence to support their use for the prevention or mitigation of COVID-19 infections. 
Nevertheless, optimal nutritional status will undoubtedly prime an individual’s immune system to protect against the effects of acute respiratory viral infections by supporting normal maintenance of the immune system [@url:https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0199/v1].
Overall, supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may be an effective method of ensuring their adequate intake to maintain optimal immune function, which may also convey beneficial effects against viral infections due to their immunomodulatory effects.
However, many supplements and nutraceuticals designed for various ailments are available in the United States and beyond that are not strictly regulated [@doi:10.1080/10408398.2019.1592107]. 
Indeed, there can be safety and efficacy concerns associated with many of these products.
Often, the vulnerable members of society can be exploited in this regard and unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic is no different.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings to several companies for advertising falsified claims in relation to the preventative and therapeutic capabilities of their products against COVID-19 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-update-fda-and-ftc-warn-seven-companies-selling-fraudulent-products-claim-treat-or].  
In light of these serious occurrences, it is pertinent to clarify that the nutraceuticals discussed in this review have been selected because of their possible relevance to the biological mechanisms that can beneficially affect viral and respiratory infections.
Therefore, further intensive investigation is required to establish the effects of these nutraceuticals, if any, against COVID-19.

### Biological Drugs for COVID-19

#### Neutralizing Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases. 
As a result, they have become some of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for HIV and Palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Although vaccines remain the most important way to prevent viral infections, their development process is long and they fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
For that reason, neutralizing antibodies have emerged to address these shortcomings.
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry through receptor binding interference [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This section discusses current efforts in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and how expertise gained from previous approaches for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may benefit antibody development.

##### Spike (S) Neutralizing Antibody

During the first SARS epidemic in 2002, nAbs were found in SARS-CoV infected patients [@doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.01009.x;@doi:10.1086/423286].
Several studies following up on these findings identified various S glycoprotein epitopes as the major targets of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
The passive transfer of immune serum containing nAbs from SARS-CoV-infected mice resulted in protection of naïve mice from viral lower respiratory tract infection upon intranasal challenge [@doi:10.1128/jvi.78.7.3572-3577.2004].
Similarly, a meta-analysis suggested that administration of plasma from recovered SARS-CoV patients reduced mortality upon SARS-CoV infection [@doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu396]. 

Similar results have been observed for MERS-CoV infections, which emerged as the second coronavirus-related epidemic.
Neutralizing antibodies have been identified against various epitopes of the RBD of the S glycoprotein [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1402074111; doi:10.1128/JVI.00912-14].

###### Anticipated Mechanisms

Coronaviruses use trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on their surface to bind to host cell receptors, such as ACE2, allowing for cell entry [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058].
Each S glycoprotein protomer is comprised of an S1 domain, also called the receptor binding domain (RBD), and an S2 domain.
The S1 domain binds to host cell receptors while the S2 domain facilitates the fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
Although targeting of the host cell receptor ACE2 shows efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection [@doi:10.1038/nature02145], given the physiological relevance of ACE2 [@doi:10/bsbp49], it would be favorable to target virus-specific structures rather than host receptors.
This forms the rationale of developing neutralizing antibodies against the S glycoprotein, disrupting its interaction with ACE2 and other receptors and thereby inhibiting viral entry.

###### Current Evidence

The first human neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 targeting the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins has been developed using hybridoma technology, [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958], where antibody-producing B-cells developed by mice can be inserted into myeloma cells to produce a hybrid cell line (the hybridoma) that is grown in culture.
The 47D11 clone was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 by a mechanism that is different from receptor binding interference.
The exact mechanism of how this clone neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and inhibits infection in vitro remains unknown, but a potential mechanism might be antibody induced destabilization of the membrane prefusion structure [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.028].
The ability of this antibody to prevent infection at a feasible dose needs to be validated in vivo, especially since in vitro neutralization effects have been shown to not be reflective of in vivo efficacy [@doi:10.1128/JVI.01603-17].
Only a week later, a different group successfully isolated multiple nAbs targeting the RBD of the S glycoprotein from blood samples taken from COVID-19 patients in China [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.21.990770].
Interestingly, the patient isolated antibodies did not cross-react with RBD’s from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although cross-reactivity to the trimeric spike proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was observed.
This suggests that the RBDs between the three coronavirus species are immunologically distinct and that the isolated nAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are species specific.
While this specificity is desirable, it also raises the question of whether these antibodies are more susceptible to viral escape mechanisms.
Viral escape is a common resistance mechanism to nAbs therapy due to selective pressure from neutralizing antibodies [@doi:10.2217/imt.15.33; @doi:10.1126/science.1213256].
For HIV, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) show greater neutralization breadth than monoclonal antibodies, which target only specific HIV strains [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2019.01.007].
For MERS-CoV, a combination of multiple neutralizing antibodies targeting different antigenic sites prevented neutralization escape [@doi:10.1128/JVI.02002-17].
It was found that the different antibody isolates did not target the same epitopes, suggesting that using them in combination might produce a synergistic effect that prevents viral escape [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.21.990770].
It was also demonstrated that binding affinity of the antibodies does not reflect their capability to compete with ACE2 binding.
Furthermore, no conclusions about correlations between the severity of disease and the ability to produce neutralizing antibodies can be drawn at this point.
Rather, higher neutralizing antibody titers were more frequently found in patients with severe disease.
Correspondingly, higher levels of anti-spike IgG were observed in patients that deceased from infection compared to patient that recovered [@doi:10.1172/jci.insight.123158].

###### Summary 

Results from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics can provide valuable lessons for the design of neutralizing antibodies for the current outbreak.
The findings for SARS-CoV and MERS can aid in identifying which structures constitute suitable targets for nAbs, despite the fact that the RBD appears to be distinct between the three coronavirus species.
These studies also suggest that a combination of nAbs targeting distinct antigens might be necessary to provide protection [@doi:10.1128/JVI.02002-17].
The biggest challenge remains identifying antibodies that not only bind to their target, but also prove to be beneficial for disease management.
On that note, a recently published study indicates that anti-spike antibodies could make the disease worse rather than eliminating the virus [@doi:10.1172/jci.insight.123158].
These findings underscores our current lack of understanding the full immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

#### Interferons

Interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines crucial to activate the first (innate) immune system response against viral infections.
Interferons are classified into three categories based on their receptor specificity: type I, II and III [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
Specifically, IFNs I (IFN-𝛼 and 𝛽) and II (IFN-𝛾 ) induce the expression of antiviral proteins which bring the viral RNA to degradation [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013].
Among these IFNs, IFN- 𝛽 was already found to strongly inhibit the replication of other corona viruses, such as SARS-CoV, in cell culture, while IFN-𝛼 and 𝛾 were shown to be less effective in this context [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013].
There are evidences that patients with higher susceptibility to develop Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) show indeed deficiency of IFN- 𝛽.
For instance, upon other Corona viruses infection IFN- 𝛽 expression and synthesis is impaired, so that the virus can in fact escape the innate immune response [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.024].

On March 18 2020 Synairgen plc has received approval to start a phase II trial for SNG001, an IFN- 𝛽-1a formulation to be delivered to lungs via inhalation.
SNG001 was already shown to be effective reducing viral load in swine flu in vivo model, as well as it has been shown to be effective in the protection from other Corona virus infection in vitro (Synairgen plc, press release).

### Vaccines 

#### Strategies for and challenges to vaccine development

Today, the first step in producing a vaccine often is characterizing the target.
The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 11, 2020, which aided the global effort to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of April 8, 2020, there were 115 vaccine candidates to prevent COVID-19, of which 78 were active. 
Of the 78 active vaccine programs, 73 were in the preclinical or exploratory stage [@doi:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5].


Historically, an H1N1 influenza vaccine was developed relatively efficiently, mainly because influenza-vaccine technology had already been developed and regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the experience producing and distributing the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into the commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. 

Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies. 
Experience in the field of oncology is encouraging COVID-19 vaccine developers to use next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152]. 
Diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus, and inactivated virus approaches. 
Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.


#### DNA Vaccines

This vaccination method involves the direct introduction of a plasmid containing a DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought into appropriate tissues [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/].

##### Anticipated Mechanism

This approach may offer several advantages over traditional vaccination approaches, such as the stimulation of both B- as well as T-cell responses and the absence of any infectious agent. 

##### Current Evidence

Currently, a Phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of INO-4800, a prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, is underway [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04336410]. 
The vaccine developer Inovio Pharmaceuticals Technology is overseeing administration of INO-4800 by intradermal injection followed by electroporation with the CELLECTRA® device to healthy volunteers. 
Electroporation is the application of brief electric pulses to tissues in order to permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner. 
It has been shown that electroporation can enhance vaccine efficacy by up to 100-fold, as measured by increases in antigen-specific antibody titers [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.008].
The safety of the CELLECTRA® device has been studied for over seven years, and these studies support the further development of electroporation as a safe vaccine delivery method [@doi:10.4161/hv.24702].
The temporary formation of pores through electroporation facilitates the successful transportation of macromolecules into cells, allowing cells to robustly take up INO-4800 for the production of an antibody response. 

Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 6, 2020, the Phase I study is enrolling up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia, PA at the Perelman School of Medicine and at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, MO. 
The trial has two experimental arms corresponding to the two locations. 
Participants in Experimental Group 1 will receive one intradermal injection of 1.0 milligram (mg) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device twice, administered at Day 0 and Week 4. 
Participants in Experimental Group 2 will receive two intradermal injections of 1.0 mg (total 2.0 mg per dosing visit) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Safety data and the initial immune responses of participants from the trial are expected by the end of the summer of 2020. 

##### Summary

The development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by Inovio could be an important step forward in the world's search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Although exciting, the cost of vaccine manufacturing and electroporation may make scaling the use of this technology for prophylactic use for the general public difficult. 

#### RNA Vaccines

RNA vaccines are nucleic-acid based modalities that code for viral antigens against which the human body elicits a humoral and cellular immune response. 
The mRNA technology is transcribed _in vitro_ and delivered to cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNP). 
They are recognized by ribosomes _in vivo_ and then translated and modified into functional proteins [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594]. 
The resulting intracellular viral proteins are displayed on surface MHC proteins, provoking a strong CD8+ T cell response as well as a CD4+ T cell and B cell-associated antibody responses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594]. 

Naturally, mRNA is not very stable and can degrade quickly in the extracellular environment or the cytoplasm. 
The LNP covering protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation outside of the cell [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006]. 
Codon optimization to prevent secondary structure formation and modifications of the poly-A tail as well as the 5’ untranslated region to promote ribosomal complex binding can increase mRNA expression in cells. 
Furthermore, purifying out dsRNA and immature RNA with FPLC (fast performance liquid chromatography) and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) technology will improve translation of the mRNA in the cell [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].

mRNA vaccines confer many advantages over traditional viral vectored vaccines and DNA vaccines. 
In comparison to live attenuated viruses, mRNA vaccines are non-infectious and can be synthetically produced in an egg-free, cell-free environment, and thereby reducing the risk of a detrimental immune response in the host [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007]. 
Unlike DNA vaccines, mRNA technologies are naturally degradable and non-integrating, and they do not need to cross the nuclear membrane in addition to the plasma membrane for their effects to be seen [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].  
Furthermore, mRNA vaccines are easily, affordably, and rapidly scalable.

Although mRNA vaccines have been developed for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, none have been licensed or commercialized thus far.
Nevertheless, they have show promise in animal models and preliminary clinical trials for several indications, including rabies, coronavirus, influenza, rabies, and cytomegalovirus [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01669096?term=mRNA+vaccine&draw=7]. 
Preclinical data from Pardi et al. identified effective antibody generation against full-length FPLC-purified influenza hemagglutinin stalk-encoding mRNA in mice, rabbits, and ferrets [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05482-0]. 
Similar immunological responses for mRNA vaccines were observed in humans in Phase I and II clinical trials operated by the pharmaceutical-development companies Curevac and Moderna for rabies, flu, and zika [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245]. 


##### Anticipated Mechanism

Positively charged bilayer LNPs carrying the mRNA attract negatively charged cell membranes, endocytose into the cytoplasm [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006], and facilitate endosomal escape. 
LNPs can be coated with modalities recognized and engulfed by specific cell types. 
LNPs 150nm or less effectively enter into lymphatic vessels. 

There are three types of RNA vaccines: non-replicating, _in vivo_ self-replicating, and _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].  
Non-replicating mRNA vaccines consist of a simple open reading frame (ORF) for the viral antigen flanked by the 5’ UTR and 3’ poly-A tail. 
_In vivo_ self-replicating vaccines encode a modified viral genome derived from single-stranded, positive sense RNA alphaviruses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245]. 
The RNA genome encodes the viral antigen along with proteins of the genome replication machinery, including an RNA polymerase.
Structural proteins required for viral assembly are not included in the engineered genome [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594]. 
Self-replicating vaccines produce more viral antigens over a longer period of time, thereby evoking a more robust immune response[@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].  
Finally, _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating RNA vaccines limit transfection to dendritic cells. 
Dendritic cells are potent antigen presenting immune cells that easily take up mRNA and present fragments of the translated peptide on their MHC proteins, which can then interact with T cell receptors.  
Ultimately, primed T follicular helper cells can stimulate germinal center B cells that also present the viral antigen to produce antibodies against the virus [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.004].
These cells are isolated from the patient, grown and transfected _ex vivo_, and re-introduced to the patient [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].


##### Current Evidence

mRNA-1273 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to enter a phase I clinical in the United States.  
ModernaTX, Inc. is currently spearheading an investigation on the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273, a conventional lipid nanoparticle encapsulated RNA encoding a full-length prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein for SARS-CoV-2 [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04283461].
Forty-five participants will be enrolled in the study and given an intramuscular injection of mRNA-1273 in their deltoid muscle on Day 1 and Day 29, and then followed for the next twelve months. 
Healthy males and non-pregnant females aged 18-55 years are being recruited and will be divided in three dosage groups receiving either 25 micrograms, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg of the vaccine. 

The study started on March 3rd, 2020, and is expected to complete by June 1st, 2021. 
Emory Vaccine Center and Kaiser Permanent Washington Health Research Institute are currently recruiting participants with NIH Clinical Center expecting to recruit soon. 
Reports on patient safety and reactogenicity will be recorded soon. 
IgG ELISA assays on patient serology samples will study the immunogenicity of the vaccine [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04283461].

##### Summary

mRNA vaccines are promising tools in the prevention and control of pandemics. 
mRNA-1273 is the only RNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 currently being tested in clinical trials and results are expected soon.

### Underexplored Therapeutics

The majority of current clinical trials and lines of investigation have focused on repurposing existing therapies to counter SARS-CoV-2 and treat its symptoms.
This is necessary given the urgency of the situation as well as the extensive time required for developing and testing new therapies.
However, in the long-term, new drugs specific for treatment of COVID-19 may also enter development.
There is thus value in investigating two lines of inquiry for treatment of COVID-19: 1) new therapeutics specific for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms, and 2) repurposing of existing therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms.
Here we consider further avenues that scientific investigators may explore in the development of therapies for COVID-19.

Given the great focus in investigating hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2, it may be of interest to researchers to explore related alternatives.
For example, hydroxyferroquine derivatives of HCQ have been described as a class of bioorganometallic compounds that exert antiviral effects with some selectivity for SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1021/jm0601856].
Future work could explore whether these compounds exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and whether they are safe for use in animals and humans.

The tocilizumab trial described in an above section [@doi:10/ggnxb3] studies the possibility of using an anti-inflammatory agent typically used for the treatment of autoimmune disease to counter the effects of the “cytokine storm” induced by the virus.
Another anti-IL-6 antibody, sarilumab, is also being investigated [@url:http://www.news.sanofi.us/2020-03-16-Sanofi-and-Regeneron-begin-global-Kevzara-R-sarilumab-clinical-trial-program-in-patients-with-severe-COVID-19; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04327388].
Typically, immunosuppressive drugs such as these are contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275].
However, COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, suggesting that immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
The decision of whether and/or when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 remains in debate as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity continue to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
If the need to curtail the “cytokine storm” inflammatory response to the virus transcends the risks of immunosuppression, exploration of more anti-inflammatory agents may be warranted; these agents are considered here.
While tocilizumab targets IL-6, several other inflammatory markers could be potential targets, including TNF-alpha. Inhibition of TNF-alpha by an inhibitor such as Etanercept has been previously suggested for treatment of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1185/030079903125002757] and may be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well.
Baricitinib and other small molecule inhibitors of the JAK kinase pathway also curtail the inflammatory response and have been suggested as potential options for SARS-CoV-2 infections [@doi:10/dph5].
Baricitinib in particular may be able to reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect lung cells [@doi:10/ggnrsx].
Clinical trials studying baricitinib in COVID-19 have already begun in the US and in Italy [@url:https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-clinical-testing-therapies-covid-19; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04320277].
Identification and targeting of further inflammatory markers that are relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be of value for curtailing the inflammatory response and lung damage.
Lastly, it is also worth noting the high costs of tocilizumab therapy and other biologics: at doses used for rheumatoid arthritis patients, the cost for tocilizumab ranges from $179.20 to $896 per dose for the IV form and $355 for the pre-filled syringe [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349513/table/T43/].
Cyclosporine may be a more cost-effective and readily-available alternative than biologics [@url:https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&context=meyers_pp], if it proves effective against the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Another approach is the development of antivirals, which could be broad-spectrum, specific to coronaviruses, or targeted to SARS-CoV-2.
Given the increasingly apparent role of the cytokine storm in disease pathogenesis, it is possible that antivirals could be less effective in more severe cases of COVID-19, but this is not yet known; regardless, it is likely that early-stage patients could benefit from antiviral therapy.
The potential for remdesivir as an antiviral has already been described in an above section. 
Development of new antivirals is complicated by the fact that none have yet been approved for human coronaviruses.
Intriguing new options are emerging, however.
Beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an orally bioavailable ribonucleotide analog showing broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses, which may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].
Various other antivirals are in development.
Development of antivirals will be further facilitated as research reveals more information about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell and host cell genome, mechanisms of viral replication, mechanisms of viral assembly, and mechanisms of viral release to other cells; this can allow researchers to target specific stages and structures of the viral life cycle.

Antibodies against viruses, also known as antiviral monoclonal antibodies, could be an alternative as well and are described in detail in an above section.
The goal of antiviral antibodies is to neutralize viruses through either cell-killing activity or blocking of viral replication [@doi:10.1016/j.tim.2015.07.005].
They may also engage the host immune response, encouraging the immune system to hone in on the virus.
Given the cytokine storm that results from immune system activation in response to the virus, which has been implicated in worsening of the disease, a neutralizing antibody (nAb) may be preferable.
Upcoming work may explore the specificity of nAbs for their target, mechanisms by which the nAbs impede the virus, and improvements to antibody structure that may enhance the ability of the antibody to block viral activity.

In the longer term, as more information becomes available about the structures of SARS-CoV-2 components, small molecule inhibitors of those components may become candidates for drug discovery.
For example, crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease have recently been resolved [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; @url:https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html#].
Efforts have already been in place to perform screens for small molecule inhibitors of the main protease, yielding potential hits [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882].
Much work remains to be done to determine further crystal structures of other viral components, understand the relative utility of targeting different viral components, perform additional small molecule inhibitor screens, and determine the safety and efficacy of the potential inhibitors.
While still nascent, work in this area is promising.
