## Vaccine Development Strategies for SARS-CoV-2

### Abstract

Vaccines have revolutionized the relationship between people and disease.
In the 21^st^ century, several emergent viruses have emphasized the importance of rapid and scalable vaccine development programs.
During the current pandemic caused by _Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2), recent biotechnological advances in vaccine design provided the circumstances for the development and deployment of vaccines at an unprecedented pace.
The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was released on January 10^th^, 2020, allowing for global efforts in vaccine development to begin within two weeks of the international community becoming aware of the new viral threat.
Both established vaccine platforms and more recently developed technologies have been explored against SARS-CoV-2.
Although historically a slow process, vaccine development in the face of COVID-19 accelerated so much that less than a year into the pandemic, some vaccine candidates had reported interim phase III clinical trial data and were being administered in countries around the world.
In this review, we examine the strategies used to develop vaccine candidates in the broader vaccine landscape.
We describe where these candidates currently stand in terms of efficacy, safety, and approval in light of the ongoing pandemic and threat from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and discuss patterns in worldwide distribution.
Vaccine development began almost five centuries ago, but the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides an exceptional illustration of how rapidly vaccine development technology has evolved in the last two decades.

### Importance

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused untold damage to the global population, but it also presented some unique opportunities for vaccine development.
As of {{csse_date_pretty}}, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over {{csse_cases}} and taken the lives of {{csse_deaths}} people globally.
The development, production, and distribution of vaccines is imperative to saving lives, preventing illness, and reducing the economic and social burdens caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Now that promising candidates exist, effective deployment will provide an opportunity to move into a new phase of the pandemic where the susceptibility of worldwide populations is significantly reduced.
This review provides a historical context for vaccine development and highlights the main strategies utilized for the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, their clinical appraisal, and their distribution.
These technologies have revolutionized the timescale at which countries can mount a response to an emerging viral threat and provide potential for mitigating future threats before their damage reaches the levels caused by SARS-CoV-2.
As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved, they also provide insight into how these technologies have to adapt on incredibly short timescales. 

### Introduction

The development of vaccines is widely considered one of the most important medical advances in human history.
The past 150 years have seen a rapid diversification in the approaches of vaccine development available [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Since the turn of the millennium, particular interest has emerged in the potential to develop vaccines as a rapid response to emerging viral threats.
Such threats have included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), "swine flu" (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola virus disease (EVD), all of which have underscored the importance of a rapid global response to a new infectious virus.
However, vaccine development has historically been slow, and because vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treatment of ongoing infections, their application to most of these epidemics has been limited [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
On the other hand, the pandemic caused by _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) has highlighted a confluence of circumstances that positioned vaccine development as a key player in efforts to control the virus and mitigate its damage.
Examining the vaccine development programs tackling the COVID-19 pandemic alongside other 21^st^ century efforts to control emerging viral threats demonstrates the significant biotechnological advances in this field.

In recent epidemics, vaccine development has not occurred rapidly enough to change the course of the disease's spread.
Indeed, one of the more successful recent programs was the development of a vaccine against H1N1 influenza, which benefited from the strong existing infrastructure for influenza vaccines, along with the fact that regulatory agencies had already determined that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
Critiques of the production and distribution of the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In most recent cases, vaccine development was still in progress when overall control of the virus was achieved.
Technologies such as inactivated viral vaccines, live attenuated viral vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, and recombinant vector-based vaccines were explored for SARS [@doi:10.3201/eid1107.050219; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro3143], although the epidemic was controlled before a vaccine became available [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
Additionally, concerns arose about whole-virus and some protein subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 potentially inducing a pathological immune response [@doi:10.1016/j.micinf.2014.05.002; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035421].
DNA vaccine development efforts also began, but did not proceed past animal testing [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro3143].
Similarly, viral vector, protein subunit, and DNA vaccines were explored for MERS-CoV, but outbreaks are sporadic and difficult to predict, making vaccine testing and the development of a vaccination strategy difficult [@doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1358325].
Likewise, the development of viral-vectored Ebola virus vaccines was undertaken, but the pace of vaccine development was behind the spread of the virus from early on [@doi:10.1126/science.345.6203.1441].
Although the candidate Ebola vaccine V920 showed promise in preclinical and clinical testing, it did not receive breakthrough therapy designation until the summer of 2016, by which time the Ebola outbreak was winding down [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.097].

The requirements for a successful vaccine trial and deployment are complex and may require coordination between government, industry, academia, and philanthropic entities [@doi:10.1126/science.abc5312].
Flu-like illnesses caused by viruses are a common target of vaccine development programs, and influenza vaccine technology in particular has made many strides.
Beyond the seasonal flu, however, a number of emergent viral threats over the past 20 years have challenged the vaccine development pipeline to respond more rapidly to previously unknown viruses.
Traditional vaccine technologies were built on the principle of using either a weakened version of the virus or a fragment of the virus.
However, more recent approaches have emerged from a paradigm shift towards reverse vaccinology.
Reverse vaccinology emphasizes a hypothesis-free, genome-mining approach to vaccine development [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.02776].
<!--To do: tie into modular-->
In light of the challenges of vaccine development, rapidly adaptable vaccine technologies that could be rapidly applied to new viruses became particularly appealing [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro3143; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.069].
Ideally, such an approach would facilitate the development of vaccines that could be adjusted to fit a novel viral threat at the minimum necessary degree and therefore could enter trials quickly in response to a new epidemic.
<!--To Do: add https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.069-->
This strategy was explored during development of a DNA vaccine against the Zika virus [@doi:10.1016/j.micinf.2018.03.001].
While once again the disease was controlled before the vaccine became available [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630], the response demonstrated the potential for modular technologies to facilitate a response to emerging viral threats [@doi:10.1016/j.micinf.2018.03.001].
The potential for technologies such as DNA and RNA vaccines to also benefit the field of oncology has encouraged vaccine developers to invest in next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Efforts to develop a DNA vaccine against MERS-CoV have also been undertaken, although they have not yet resulted in a vaccine [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro3143].
As a result, during the COVID-19 pandemic modular technologies have taken center stage in controlling a viral threat for the first time.

### Challenges and Opportunities in Developing a Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 rapidly induced a global public health crisis.
This viral threat did not follow the same trajectory as other emergent viruses of recent note, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus, none of which reached the level of pandemic.
Spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has remained out of control in many parts of the world throughout 2021, especially with the emergence of variants that have increased rates of transmission [@individual-pathogenesis].
While, for a variety of reasons, SARS-CoV-2 was not controlled as rapidly as the viruses underlying prior 21^st^ century epidemics, vaccine development technology had also progressed based on these and other prior viral threats to the point that a rapid international vaccine development response was possible.
The first critical step towards developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was characterizing the viral target, which happened extremely early in the COVID-19 outbreak with the sequencing and dissemination of the viral genome in early January 2020 [@url:https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/] (Figure @fig:virus).
This genomic information allowed for an early identification of the sequence of the spike (_S_) protein (Figure @fig:virus), which is the antigen and induces an immune response [@doi:10/fmq2; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.576622].

**Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.**
The development of vaccines depends on the immune system recognizing the virus.
Here, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is represented both in the abstract and against a visualization of the virion.
The abstracted visualization was made using BioRender [@url:https://biorender.com/] and the microscopy was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [@url:https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/novel-coronavirus-sarscov2-images].<!--To Do: Was a template used?-->
](images/SARS_CoV_2.png){#fig:virus secno=1}

For a highly infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2, vaccines hold particular value because they can bolster the immune response to the virus of the population broadly, thereby driving a lower rate of infection and likely significantly reducing fatalities.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of September 2020, there were over 180 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in development [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].
While little is currently known about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development typically tests for serum neutralizing activity, as this has been established as a biomarker for adaptive immunity in other respiratory illnesses [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].
However, unlike in efforts to develop vaccines for prior viral threats, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it possible to test vaccine in phase III trials where the effect of the vaccine on a cohort's likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 can be evaluated.
With vaccine candidates at all stages of development including approved vaccines in many countries, unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies.

### Cross-Platform Considerations in Vaccine Development

There are some decisions that can affect vaccine development across a number of platforms.
One decision applies to platforms that deliver the antigen, which in the case of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is the Spike (S) protein.
The prefusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is metastable [@doi:10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118056], and the release of energy during membrane fusion drives this process forward following destabilization [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301; @doi:10.1038/nature17200].
Due to the significant conformational changes that occur during membrane fusion [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058; @doi:10.1016/j.str.2020.10.001; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2665-2], S protein immunogens that are stabilized in the prefusion conformation are of particular interest, especially because a prefusion stabilized MERS-CoV S antigen was found to elicit an improved antibody response [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1707304114].
Moreover, the prefusion conformation offers an opportunity to target S2, a region of the S protein that accumulates mutations at a slower rate [@doi:10.3390/v4061011; @doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1707304114] (see also [@individual-pathogenesis]).
Vaccine developers can use versions of the S protein that contain mutations that stabilize the prefusion conformer, essentially locking them in this position [@doi:10.1126/science.abd0826].
The immune response to the spike protein when it is stabilized in this conformation is improved over other S structures [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x].
Thus, vaccines that use this prefusion stabilized conformation are expected to not only offer improved immunogenicity, but also be more resilient to the accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2.

Another consideration is the use of adjuvants.
Adjuvants include a variety of molecules or larger microbial-related products that have an effect on the immune system or an immune response of interest.
They can either be comprised of or contain immunostimulants or immunomodulators.
Adjuvants are sometimes included within vaccines in order to enhance the immune response.
Different adjuvants can regulate different types of immune responses, so the type or combination of adjuvants used in a vaccine will depend on both the type of vaccine and concern related to efficacy and safety.
A variety of possible mechanisms for adjuvants have been researched [@doi:10.1038/nri2510; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2018.02619; @doi:10.3390/vaccines8010128], including the following: induction of DAMPs that can be recognized by certain PRRs of the innate immune system; functioning as PAMP that can also be recognized by certain PRRs; and more generally enhancing the humoral or cellular immune responses.
Selection of one or more adjuvants requires considering how to promote the advantageous effects of the components and/or immune response and, likewise, to inhibit possible deleterious effects.
There are also considerations related to the method of delivering (or co-delivering) the adjuvant and antigen components of a vaccine.

### COVID-19 Vaccine Development Platforms

![
**Vaccine Development Strategies.**
Several different strategies can and are being employed for the development of vaccines today.
Each approach capitalizes on different features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and delivery through a different platform.
All of these approaches are being explored in the current pandemic.<!--To Do: define LNP, define mRNA, define S protein.

](images/N002-Vaccines.png){#fig:vaccines secno=1}

Vaccination emerged early on as a strategy of interest for managing the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first human trial participant receiving a dose on March 16, 2020 [@url:https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19; @doi:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5].
Within a few weeks, by April 8, 78 vaccine development programs could be confirmed as active, with an additional 37 unconfirmed [@doi:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5].
These programs explored a wide variety of technologies.
As of {{owid_most_recent_date}}, {{owid_vaccine_types}} types of vaccines are being administered throughout the world, with {{owid_total_vaccinations}} doses administered across {{owid_total_countries}} countries.
Many vaccines are available in only a subset of countries, and the types of vaccines available varies widely throughout the world.
The types of vaccines and specific vaccine candidates are continuing to evolve (Figure @fig:vaccines).

#### Whole-Virus Vaccines

Whole-virus vaccines have the longest history among vaccine development approaches. 
The first vaccination strategy in human history is widely considered to be the practice of variolation, which makes the history of vaccine development almost 500 years long [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2].
Famously employed as a strategy to improve survival of smallpox by, for example, exposing a healthy individual to pus from smallpox pustules [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611; @doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2], variolation provides a mechanism for infecting a healthy individual with a mild case of a disease.
This strategy aims to confer adaptive immunity, but it also carries a number of risks for the vaccine recipient [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032].
The approach was (debatably) the first example of a live-attenuated virus being used to induce immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Many subsequent efforts to develop live-attenuated viral vaccines relied on either the identification of related zoonotic viruses that are less virulent in humans (e.g., cowpox/horsepox or rotavirus vaccines) or efforts to attenuate the virus through culturing it _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111; @doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611].
Such approaches still carried risks, however [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Efforts to overcome the limitations of live-virus vaccines led to the development of approaches to inactivate viruses (circa 1900) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1402981111].
Inactivated viral vaccines still raised some concerns about safety, including that back-mutations could potentially lead the inactivated vaccines to become virulent or that recombination could occur between the inactivated virus and other viruses in circulation [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
For example, in the famous 1955 Cutter incident, errors in the manufacturing process produced polio vaccines containing live polio virus, leading to an outbreak in the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp048180].
Potential concerns about contamination can apply to several vaccination approaches within this category, including those that use attenuated viruses [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611].
Additionally, one of the major limitations of inactivated whole-virus vaccines is their susceptibility to losing efficacy due to mutations in the epitopes of the circulating virus [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
This loss of specificity over time is likely to be influenced by the evolution of the virus, and specifically by the rate of evolution in the region of the genome that codes for the antigen.

While these approaches emerged historically, they are still valuable tools in vaccine development.
The technologies that shaped vaccine development throughout the 1900s remain in use today [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
In fact, as of 2005, most vaccines still used live-attenuated or inactivated pathogens [@doi:10/dn299p].
Whole virus approaches have also been evaluated for COVID-19.

##### Live-Attenuated Virus Vaccines

**Mechanism:**
Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV), or replication-competent vaccines, use a weakened living version of a disease-causing virus or a version of a virus that is modified to induce an immune response [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3]. 
The virus can be attenuated by passaging it in a foreign host until, as a consequence of selection pressure, the virus loses its efficacy in the original host. 
Alternatively, selective gene deletion or codon de-optimization can be utilized to attenuate the virus [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3]. 
Foreign antigens can also be integrated into an attenuated viral vector [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].

**Prior Applications:**
The first deliberate attempt to utilize an attenuated viral vaccine dates back to Louis Pasteur in 1885, despite his not knowing that the disease-causing agent he was experimenting with was a virus.
The next intentional LAVs developed were intended to prevent illness caused by the yellow fever virus in 1935, followed by the first influenza vaccine in 1936 [@doi:10.1128/9781555818951]. 
Today, LAVs are used globally to prevent diseases caused by viruses such as measles, rubella, polio, influenza, varicella zoster, and the yellow fever virus [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-35761-6.00002-X].
It is generally recognized that LAVs induce an immune response similar to natural infection, and they are favored because they induce long-lasting and robust immunity that can protect from disease. 
This strong protective effect is induced in part by the immune response to the range of viral antigens available from LAV, which tend to be more immunogenic than those from non-replicating vaccines [@url:https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256]. 
LAVs are also favored because they tend to be restricted to viral replication in the tissues around the location of inoculation [@doi:10.1128/9781555818951], and some can be administered intranasally [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3]. 
Previously, there were attempts to develop both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV LAVs [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256], but no vaccines were approved for use in humans.
While safety in production was a major concern in the past, nowadays manufacturers of LAVs use safe and reliable methods to produce large quantities of vaccines once they have undergone rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy.

**Application to COVID-19:**
Although LAV development strategies have the longest history, this strategy has not been widely utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. 
There is general concern that LAV strategies may risk causing disease in individuals who are immunocompromised [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2007.10.010], which is an even greater concern when dealing with a novel virus and disease. 
All the same, there are at least five COVID-19 LAV candidates in the early (preclinical/phase I) stages of investigation.
One candidate in the preclinical stage is YF-S0, a single-dose LAV that uses live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) as a vector for a noncleavable prefusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen.
YF-S0 induced a robust immune response in three animal models and prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques and hamsters [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].
Other programs are exploring the development of codon deoptimized LAV [@url:https://news.griffith.edu.au/2020/04/23/griffith-university-researchers-on-the-road-to-covid-19-vaccine; @url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org; @doi:10.1073/pnas.2102775118].
This strategy leverages the fact that different organisms display different biases in which synonymous codons are preferred to select codons that will be less optimal in the target organism without altering the amino acids encoded [@doi:10.1128/mBio.00039-20].
New York-based Codagenix and the Serum Institute of India reported a successful preclinical investigation [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2102775118] of an intranasally administered deoptimized SARS-CoV-2 LAV known as COVI-VAC, and COVI-VAC entered phase I human trials and dosed its first participants in January 2021 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04619628; @url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org].
It is anticipated that the COVI-VAC phase I human trials will be completed by May 2022.
Another company, Meissa Vaccines in Kansas, U.S.A., which also develops vaccines for _Respiratory syncytial virus_ (RSV), has developed an intranasal live-attenuated chimeric vaccine.
Chimeric vaccines integrate genomic content from multiple viruses to create a more stable LAV [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2019.02881].
Enrollment for phase I human trials began in March 2021 and recruitment is ongoing [@clinicaltrials:NCT04798001; @url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org].
Finally, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines that use LAVs are being investigated for the prophylaxis of COVID-19.
The purpose of the BCG vaccine is to prevent tuberculosis; however, it is known to exert protective non-specific effects against other respiratory tract infections in _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies [@doi:10.1016/j.cmi.2019.04.020], hence the interest many have for its potential use against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0337-y].
Currently, investigations of BCG vaccines against COVID-19 are being sponsored by institutes in Australia in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [@clinicaltrials:NCT04327206] and by Texas A&M University in collaboration with numerous other U.S. institutions [@clinicaltrials:NCT04348370].
Thus, as 2021 draws to a close, results from LAV are largely unavailable and no LAV vaccine is available.
Despite the long and trusted history of LAV development, this vaccine strategy does not appear to be favored for vaccine development against COVID-19.
Modern technologies such as mRNA vaccines and vectored vaccines seem to have been favored due to their expediency and safety versus the time-consuming nature of developing LAVs using a novel virus.

##### Inactivated Whole-Virus Vaccines

**Mechanism:**
Inactivated whole-virus vaccines are another well-established technology.
These types of vaccines use full virus particles generally produced via cell culture that have been rendered non-infectious by chemical (i.e., formaldehyde or &beta;-propiolactone [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1357471]) or physical (i.e., heat or ultraviolet radiation) means.
Though these virus particles are inactivated, they still have the capacity to prime the immune system.
The size of the virus particle makes it ideal for uptake by an antigen-presenting cell (APC), which leads to stimulation of helper T-cells [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
Additionally, the array of epitopes on the surface of the virus increases antibody binding efficiency [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
The native conformation of the surface proteins, which is also important for eliciting an immune response, is preserved using these techniques [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.03.025].
Membrane proteins, which support B-cell responses to surface proteins, are also included using this method [@doi:10.1084/jem.164.4.1114].
It has, however, been noted that different inactivation techniques and combinations of these techniques can lead to different immune responses in preclinical studies [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256; @doi:10.1002/rmv.492]. 
Therefore, optimization of these strategies may be necessary in preclinical studies prior to human trials. 
Overall, these vaccines are able to mimic the key properties of the virus that stimulate a robust immune response, but the risk of adverse reactions is reduced because the virus is inactivated and thus unable to replicate.

**Prior Applications:**
This platform has been a valuable tool in efforts to control many viruses, and some well-known whole virus vaccines targets include influenza viruses, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus.
Inactivated vaccines are generally considered the fastest to generate once the pathogenic virus has been isolated and can be passaged in cell culture [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256], although this was not the case for the COVID-19 pandemic due to the advent of mRNA technologies and due to caution surrounding a novel coronavirus (discussed below).
Past research on inactivated coronavirus vaccines has predominantly focused on SARS-CoV-1 and to a lesser extent MERS-CoV.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-1 vaccines tend to elicit immune responses _in vivo_.  
These vaccines can generate considerable neutralizing antibody titers at similar concentrations to those evoked by recombinant protein vaccines [@doi:10.1002/rmv.492; @doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.03.025]. 
Studies in ferrets and non-human primates have demonstrated that inactivated whole virus vaccines can offer protection against infection due to neutralizing antibody and SARS-CoV-1-specific T cell responses [@doi:10.1093/intimm/dxh143].
However, several attempts to develop both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV inactivated vaccines have been hindered by incidences of vaccine-associated disease enhancement (VADE) in preclinical studies [@doi:10.1038/s41579-020-00462-y].
In one example of a study in macaques, an inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccine induced even more severe lung damage due to an enhanced immune reaction [@doi:10.1021/acsinfecdis.6b00006].
Independent studies in mice have also demonstrated evidence of lung immunopathology due to VADE in response to MERS-CoV inactivated vaccines [@doi:10.1080/21645515.2016.1177688; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00554-20].
The exact mechanisms responsible for VADE are still elusive due to the specificity of the virus-host interactions involved, but VADE is the subject of investigation in preclinical SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies to ensure the safety of any potential vaccines that may reach phase I trials and beyond [@doi:10.1038/s41579-020-00462-y].

**Application to COVID-19:**
Several whole-virus vaccines have been developed against COVID-19 and are available in countries around the world.
As of {{owid_most_recent_date}}, {{owid_inactivated_whole_virus_count}} vaccines developed with inactivated-whole virus technology are being distributed in {{owid_inactivated_whole_virus_countries}} countries (Figure @fig:iwv-distrib).
One example is CoronaVac, which Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac developed using a &beta;-propiolactone-inactivated whole virus produced using Vero cells coupled with the addition of an aluminum adjuvant [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256].
In phase I and II clinical trials, CoronaVac elicited a strong immunogenic response in animal models and the development of neutralizing antibodies in human participants [@doi:10/fx8z; @doi:10.1126/science.abc1932; @doi:10/fpcx].
Phase III trials of CoronaVac began in Brazil, July 2020, which was followed by trial participant recruitment in Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile, and emergency use approval in China [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/sinovac-covid-19-vaccine.html].
Results of the two-dose phase III trial (14-day prime boost) were initially made public via press release on December 23^rd^, 2020 and later published [@doi:10/gk898z].
An interim preprint analysis of a Chilean placebo-controlled trial of CoronaVac indicated that specific IgG neutralizing antibodies against S1-RBD and a robust IFN-&gamma; secreting T cell response was induced via immunization with CoronaVac with only minimal adverse reactions reported in 270 vaccinated individuals versus 164 people administered placebo [@doi:10.1101/2021.03.31.21254494].
CoronaVac was approved for use in China, and has been granted emergency use in Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uruguay [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html#sinovac].<!--To Do: clean citation, automate to specify number of countriess?-->
Sinovac has reported that they have produced over a billion doses of CoronaVac as of August 2021 and have donated vaccines to COVAX [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].

Other programs have been led through industry partnerships with governmental organizations.
Similarly, in India, the biggest producer of vaccines globally, Bharat Biotech International Ltd., in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV) has developed COVAXIN^®^ (also referred to as BBV152).
Preclinical studies of COVAXIN^®^ in hamsters [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-76768/v1] and macaques [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-21639-w] indicated that the vaccine induced protective responses deemed sufficient to move forward to human trials. 
Phase I and phase I/II studies reported in _The Lancet_ indicated that the COVAXIN^®^ vaccine candidate adjuvanted with alum and a Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist is safe and immunogenic and that it induces Th1-skewed memory T-cell responses, with only mild to moderate side-effects reported upon immunization [@doi:10/gkrthh; @doi:10/gh7597].
Two inactivated vaccine candidates were also developed by the stated-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. more commonly known as Sinopharm CNBG. 
The Beijing branch of the company developed the BBIBP-CorV (Vero cells) vaccine, whereas the Wuhan branch also developed an inactivated (Vero cells) vaccine. 
The BBIBP-CorV vaccine was developed using the HB02 strain of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COVID-19 patients.
This strain was selected due to its optimal viral replication and yield generation.
The viruses were purified, propagated using Vero cells, isolated, and inactivated using &beta;-propiolactone and adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008].
Preclinical studies indicated that the BBIBP-CorV vaccine induced sufficient neutralizing antibody titers in mice, and a prime-boost immunization scheme of 2 &mu;g/dose was sufficient to protect rhesus macaques from disease [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008].

]({{owid_inactivated_whole_virus_map}} "Availability of inactivated whole virus vaccines"){#fig:iwv-distrib secno=1}

**Efficacy Estimates:**
The efficacy of whole-virus vaccines estimated during phase III trials varied widely, and in some cases, even estimates for a single vaccine candidate differed across analyses.
In phase III trials, Sinopharm CNBG's BBIBP-CorV vaccine made from the WIV04 strain achieved an efficacy of 72.8% and was well tolerated [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.8565].
Sinopharm affiliates in the UAE in early December 2020 claimed the vaccine had 86% efficacy, which was later at odds with a Sinopharm Beijing affiliate that stated that the BBIBP-CorV vaccine had a 79.34% efficacy later that same month [https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-china-vaccine-int-idUSKBN2940CA].
Similarly, CoronaVac demonstrated an efficacy of a little over 50% in Brazil, which was contested by Turkish officials claiming an efficacy of 91.25%, but ultimately after multiple announcements, the efficacy debate was settled at over 50% [@url:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sinovac-brazil/brazil-institute-says-coronavac-efficacy-above-50-but-delays-full-results-idUSKBN28X2CR; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/health/turkey-brazil-sinovac-coronavirus-vaccine.html].
Since these announcements, several of the CoronaVac phase III trials have been published.
An interim analysis of the phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted in Turkey enrolling 10,214 participants (~2:1 vaccine:placebo) has indicated that CoronaVac has a vaccine efficacy of 83.5%, with minimal side effects reported [@doi:10/gk898z], and a prospective national cohort study in Chile reported an adjusted estimated effectiveness of 66% for the prevention of COVID-19 with an estimated 90% and 87% prevention of hospitalization and death, respectively [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107715].
Therefore, it is difficult to ascribe a particular efficacy to these vaccines given the variation in reports.

Furthermore, the effect of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on vaccine efficacy holds particular concern for whole-virus vaccines.
In agreement with previous studies demonstrating sera from individuals vaccinated with COVAXIN^®^ efficiently neutralized the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and the delta variant (B.1.617.2) [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.30.454511; @doi:10.1093/jtm/taab104; @doi:10.1093/jtm/taab051], the phase III trial reported a 65.2% efficacy against the delta variant (B.1.617.2) [@doi:10.1101/2021.06.30.21259439]; however, studies suggested the beta variant was more resistant (compared to the wildtype and alpha variants) to neutralizing antibodies in sera from individuals immunized with Sinovac [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2103022].  
Indeed, a study in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ showed that the alpha variant exhibited very little resistance to neutralization by sera of those immunized with BBIBP-CorV, but the beta variant was more resistant to neutralization by almost a factor of 3 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2103022]. 
Notably, a preprint reported that antisera from 12 people immunized with BBIBP-CorV exhibited neutralizing antibody capacity against the beta variant (B.1.351), wild type SARS-CoV-2 (NB02), and one of the original variants of SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.01.429069].
Another preprint including sera from 282 participants used a surrogate neutralizing assay, a test that generally correlates with neutralizing antibodies, to determine that BBIBP-CorV appears to induce neutralizing antibodies against the binding of the RBD of wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the alpha, beta, and delta variants to ACE2 [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.15.21260621].

**Duration of Immunity:**

Booster immunization is suggested for several whole-virus vaccines.
Examples include CoronaVac, for which a phase IV clinical trial is underway in China [@clinicaltrials:NCT04962308], and COVAXIN [@url:https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-booster-dose-what-is-it-what-does-govt-say-about-this-101625644184446.html].
A phase I/II clinical trial of CoronaVac in an elderly cohort (adults 60 years and older) in China has determined that by 6 to 8 months following the second dose, neutralizing antibody titers were detected below the seropositive cutoff [@doi:10.1101/2021.08.03.21261544].
One preprint has reported that 6 months after the second vaccination, a booster dose of CoronaVac markedly increased geometric mean titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.23.21261026].
However, the reduction of neutralizing antibodies was ameliorated by a booster dose administered 8 months after the second CoronaVac dose. 
A preprint study of healthcare workers in China has since indicated that a booster shot of BBIBP-CorV elevates B cell and T cell responses and increases neutralizing antibody titers [@doi:10.1101/2021.09.12.21263373].
In May 2021, the UAE announced it would consider booster shots for all citizens who had been immunized with BBIBP-CorV, which was shortly followed by a similar announcement in Bahrain, and by August 29^th^, 2021, the UAE mandated booster shots for all residents who had received BBIBP-CorV [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].
Additionally, heterogeneous vaccine boosters are also being considered in many cases.
Chinese [@url:https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-08-china-mixed-vaccine-trial-delta.html] and Chilean [@clinicaltrials:NCT04992182] researchers have opted to investigate options to administer different vaccines (e.g., an mRNA vaccine dose) as a booster dose to individuals who have already received two doses of CoronaVac. 
Another study has already determined that using the CanSino vaccine (Convidecia) instead of CoronaVac in a prime-boost vaccination regimen can induce a more robust immune response [@doi:10.1101/2021.09.03.21263062].

#### Subunit Vaccines

**Mechanism:**<!--To Do: Add to figure-->
Efforts to overcome the limitations of live-virus vaccines led to the development of approaches to inactivate viruses (circa 1900) and to purify proteins from viruses cultured in eggs (circa 1920) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1402981111].
Unlike inactivated whole virus vaccines, which introduce the whole virus, in subunit vaccines, one or more proteins or peptides of the virus is isolated and used to stimulate the immune system.
Typically, such vaccines use antigens located on the surface of the viral particle and are therefore key targets of the immune system.

Several different technologies are used to develop vaccines in this category.
Proteins can be grown in yeast and then harvested, as they are culturable devoid of animal-derived growth factors. 
Indeed, the vaccine industry has previously mostly used _Pichia pastoris_ yeast as the expression system  [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256].
However, in recent years insect cells have also been utilized [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.016; @doi:10.1016/j.addr.2021.01.001].
Other protein subunit vaccines utilize virus-like particles (VLPs), which share the conformation of a virus's capsid, thereby acting as an antigen, but lack the replication machinery [@doi:10/dg35hw].
VLPs are often synthesized using nanotechnology [@doi:10.1038/nri3488].

The main advantage of this platform is that protein subunit vaccines are considered very safe, as the antigen alone cannot cause an infection [@doi:10.1016/j.addr.2021.01.001].
Protein subunit vaccines can stimulate antibodies and CD4^+^ T-cell responses [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-1823-5; @doi:10/dg35hw]. 
This platform is also favored for its consistency in production and defined components designed for a highly targeted immune response to a specific pathogen using synthetic immunogenic particles that can be designed to avoid allergen and reactogenic sequences [@doi:10.3390/vaccines2030515].
The immune response generated by protein subunit vaccines is weaker, and adjuvants are usually required to boost the response [@doi:10.1517/14712598.2011.573624] (see Appendix). 
These adjuvants are immunogenic substances, which include, for example, alum (aluminum hydroxide), squalene- or saponin-based adjuvants, and Freund’s incomplete/complete adjuvants [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.055; @doi:10.3390/vaccines2030515]. 

**Prior Applications:**
Prior protein subunit vaccine development efforts for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have mostly focused on the immunogenic RBD of the S protein [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.06.084; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.031; @doi:10.1089/vim.2009.0090].
There have been several approaches investigated in the search for a potential SARS-CoV-1 vaccine, including vaccines targeting the full-length or trimeric S protein [@doi:10.1128/JVI.00083-06; @doi:10.1089/vim.2012.0076], those focused on the RBD protein only [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.031; @doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.003; @doi:10.1089/vim.2009.0090; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.06.084] or non-RBD S protein fragments [@doi:10.1089/vim.2012.0076; @doi:10.1089/dna.2005.24.510], as well as the N and M proteins [@doi:10.1128/jcm.43.8.3718-3726.2005; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.073; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.01.058]; these efforts have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298].
There have been examples of success in preclinical research including candidate RBD219N-1, a 218-amino-acid residue of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD that, when adjuvanted to aluminum hydroxide, was capable of eliciting a high RBD-specific and neutralizing antibody response in both pseudovirus and live virus infections of immunized mice [@doi:10.4161/hv.27464].
Several subunit-based approaches have also been used to investigate potential vaccines against MERS.
VLPs have been investigated for development of vaccines against MERS and SARS [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.003; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.04.016] including testing in animal models [@doi:10.18632/oncotarget.8475; @doi:10.1007/s12250-018-0064-8].
Other strategies investigating the potential use of the full length S DNA have also been investigated in mice and rhesus macaques, which elicited immune responses [@doi:10.1038/ncomms8712], but these responses were not as effective as the combination of S DNA and the S1 subunit protein together [@doi:10.1038/ncomms8712; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.015].
Similarly to the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine candidates, the MERS-CoV protein subunit vaccine candidates generally target the RBD [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.031; @doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.031; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112602; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.065; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2016.10.005], with some targeting the full length S protein [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1707304114], non-RBD protein fragments such as the SP3 peptide [@doi:10.1089/vim.2014.0080], and the recombinant N-terminal domain (rNTD) [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.11.064].
No protein subunit vaccine for MERS-CoV has progressed beyond preclinical research to date. 

**Application to COVID-19:**
More than 20 protein subunit vaccines from companies such as Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline, Nanogen, and the Serum Institute of India have entered clinical trials for COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic [@url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines].
Most of these vaccine candidates are designed using either the full-length S protein or the RBD specifically as an antigen, although some use several different SARS-CoV-2 proteins [@doi:10.1016/j.addr.2021.01.001].
However, the NVX-CoV2373, produced by U.S. company Novavax and partners has had the most success to date. 
NVX-CoV2373 is a protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 that is constructed from a mutated prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in combination with a specialized saponin-based adjuvant to elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. 
The spike protein is recombinantly expressed in Sf9 insect cells [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8], which have previously been used for several other FDA-approved protein therapeutics [@doi:10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00985], and contains mutations in the furin cleavage site (682-RRAR-685 to 682-QQAQ-685) along with two proline substitutions (K986P and V987P) that improve thermostability [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8]. 
In preclinical mouse models, Novavax-CoV2373 elicited high anti-spike IgG titers 21 to 28 days post-vaccination that could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and protect the animals against viral challenge, with particularly strong effects when administered with the proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M^TM^ [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8]. 
In a phase I/II trial, a two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 was found to induce anti-spike IgG levels and neutralizing antibody-titers exceeding those observed in convalescent plasma donated by symptomatic patients [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2026920]. 
In line with the preclinical studies, the use of Matrix-M adjuvant further increased anti-spike immunoglobulin levels and induced a Th1 response. 
The development of a protein subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is a remarkable achievement given the short period of time since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, particularly considering these types of vaccines have not played a major role in previous pandemics.  
However, protein subunit vaccines do play a role in public health and have contributed to vaccination against hepatitis B [@doi:10/d4g86c] and pertussis [@doi:10.1128/mBio.01339-14; @doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003418] since the 1980s and will likely continue to contribute to public health for the foreseeable future due to ongoing research in vaccines against influenza, SARS-CoV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, dengue virus, and human papillomavirus among others [@doi:10.1016/j.micinf.2014.12.006; @https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines; @doi:10.1080/21655979.2016.1191707].

**Efficacy Estimates:**
In a phase III randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 14,039 participants, two 5-&mu;g doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo were administered 21 days apart in a 1:1 ratio from late September to late November 2020 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107659].
Novavax efficacy was reported to be 89.7%, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported in the vaccine group, and a total of 10 patients developing COVID-19 in the vaccine group versus 96 in the placebo group [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107659].
An additional phase III randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the U.S. and Mexico, enrolling 29,949 participants and administering at least 1 vaccine in a 2:1 ratio from late December 2020 to late February 2021 with the same primary endpoints as the U.K. trial [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264567].
Again, the vaccine was well tolerated, and a vaccine efficacy of 90.4% was reported based on 77 cases total, 63 of which occurred in the placebo group.
All moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group.
The conclusions of both trials indicate that the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine is safe and effective against COVID-19, and those who received this vaccine through the trials are considered fully vaccinated [@url:https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Statement-on-UK-and-Mexico-Phase-3-Clinical-Trial-Participants-Considered-Fully-Vaccinated-in-the-US].

To date, data about the effect of viral evolution on the efficacy of subunit vaccines has been limited.
_Post hoc_ analysis in the phase III trial determined that the NovaVax vaccine had an efficacy of 86.3% against the Alpha variant (identified based on the presence/absence of the 69–70del polymorphism) and 96.4% against other variants [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107659].
In the second phase III trial [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264567], whole-genome sequencing was obtained from 61 of the 77 cases, and 79% of infections were identified as a VOC or VOI that had been characterized at the time of the study.
Vaccine efficacy against cases caused by VOC, among which the Alpha variant was predominant (88.6%), was reported to be 92.6% [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264567]. 
In late 2020, an analysis of efficacy in South African adults revealed an overall efficacy of 60.1% and a slightly lower efficacy of 50.1% against B.1.351 in particular [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2103055].

#### Nucleic Acid Vaccines

While traditional methods of vaccine development such as inactivated whole viruses are still used today (Figure @fig:vaccines), biomedical research in the 21^st^ century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution, and vaccine development is no exception.
The shift towards omics-based approaches to vaccine development began to take hold with the development of the meningococcal type B vaccine using reverse vaccinology in the early 2010s [@doi:10.7774/cevr.2014.3.1.1; @doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x].
In this way, the genomic revolution catalyzed a fundamental shift in the development of vaccines.
These vaccine technologies could potentially provide a future approach to addressing one of the major limitations of vaccines today due to their potential to function therapeutically rather than just prophylactically [@doi:10.3390/vaccines7020037].

Nucleic-acid based approaches are all based on the shared underlying principle that utilizing a vector to deliver the information to produce an antigen can trigger an immune response to the antigen without introducing an infectious agent.
Such approaches build on subunit vaccination strategies, where a component of a vaccine (e.g., an antigenic protein) is delivered.
Platforms based on genomic sequencing began to be explored beginning in the 1980s as genetic research became increasingly feasible.
Advances in genetic engineering allowed for gene sequences of specific viral antigens to be grown _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Studies also demonstrated that model organisms could be induced to construct antigens that would trigger an immune response [@doi:10/dn299p; @doi:10.1001/jama.1994.03510360055036; @doi:10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01140.x].
These two developments meant that it could be possible to identify any or all of the antigens encoded by a virus's genome and train the immune response to recognize them.
In nucleic-acid-based approaches, the genome of a pathogen is screened to identify potential vaccine targets [@doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x], and pathogens of interest are then expressed _in vitro_ and tested in animal models to determine their immunogenicity [@doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x]. 
By inducing the host to express the antigen, such vaccines can activate immune pathways via both MHC I and MHC II [@doi:10.1358/dot.2018.54.5.2807864] instead of MHC II alone as with prior technologies [@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01140.x], meaning that both humoral and cellular immunity are activated [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Thus, in addition to lacking an infectious agent, these approaches are likely to offer several advantages over more traditional immunization platforms because they can stimulate both B- and T-cell responses [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.008; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432].

The delivery and presentation of antigens is fundamental to inducing immunity against a virus.
Vaccines that deliver nucleic acids allow the introduction of foreign substances to the body to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Delivering a nucleic acid sequence to host cells allows the host to synthesize an antigen without exposure to a viral threat [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Host-synthesized antigens can then be presented in complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II, which can activate either T- or B-cells [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
While these vaccines encode specific proteins, providing many of the benefits of a protein subunit vaccine, they do not carry any risk of DNA being live, replicating, or spreading, and their manufacturing process lends itself to scalability [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
<!--To Do: Summarize difference between replicating and non-replicating. How does plasmid fit in? see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245896/-->
Here, opportunities can be framed in terms of the central dogma of genetics: instead of directly providing the proteins from the infectious agents, vaccines developers are exploring the potential for the delivery of DNA or RNA to induce the cell to produce proteins from the virus that in turn induce a host immune response.

##### DNA Vaccines

Nucleic acid information can be deliver antigen information to host cells using DNA.
However, early attempts to use these technologies to develop vaccines revealed that DNA translated poorly to humans due to low immunogenicity [@doi:10/dn299p; @doi:10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01140.x; @doi:10.3390/ijms19113605].
Initially, concerns were raised that DNA vaccines might bind to the host genome or induce autoimmune disease [@doi:10.1358/dot.2018.54.5.2807864; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432], but pre-clinical and clinical studies have consistently disproved this hypothesis and indicated DNA vaccines to be safe [@doi:10.3390/ijms19113605].
Many of the safety concerns raised about DNA vaccines were not found to be an issue during preclinical and phase I testing, although antibiotic resistance introduced during the plasmid selection process remained a concern during this initial phase of development [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
However, the immunogenicity of these vaccines has also not reached expectations [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Despite initially disappointing immunogenicity in clinical trials [@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01140.x], a number of developments during the 2010s led to greater efficacy of DNA vaccines [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
However, no DNA vaccines had been approved for use in humans prior to the COVID-19 pandemic [@doi:10.3390/ijms19113605; @doi:10.3390/pharmaceutics12010030].

##### Plasmid-Vectored DNA Vaccines

**Mechanism:**
Many DNA vaccines use a plasmid vector-based approach, where the sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought can be cultivated in a plasmid and delivered directly to an appropriate tissue [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en].
Plasmids can also be designed to act as adjuvants by encoding molecules that supplement the immune response, such as immune stimulant molecules [@doi:10.1358/dot.2018.54.5.2807864].
The DNA itself may also stimulate the innate immune response [@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01140.x].
Once the plasmid brings the DNA sequence to an APC, the host machinery can be used to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, and the body can then synthesize antibodies in response [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
In the 1990s and 2000s, DNA vaccines delivered via plasmids sparked significant scientific interest, leading to a large number of preclinical trials [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
<!--Add info from 10.3390/vaccines1030225-->

**Prior Applications:**
Early preclinical trials primarily focused on long-standing disease threats, including viral diseases such as rabies and bacterial diseases such as malaria, and promising results led to phase I testing of the application of this technology to HIV, influenza, malaria, and other diseases of concern during this period [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Although they were well-tolerated, these early attempts to develop vaccines were generally not very successful in inducing immunity to the target pathogen, with either limited T-cell or limited neutralizing antibody responses observed [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].

**Applications to COVID-19:**
<!--To Do: Add background on how the INO-4800 vaccine is designed-->
Currently, a Phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of INO-4800, a prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, is underway [@clinicaltrials:NCT04336410].
The vaccine developer Inovio Pharmaceuticals Technology is overseeing administration of INO-4800 by intradermal injection followed by electroporation with the CELLECTRA® device to healthy volunteers.
Electroporation is the application of brief electric pulses to tissues in order to permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner.
It has been shown that electroporation can enhance vaccine efficacy by up to 100-fold, as measured by increases in antigen-specific antibody titers [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.008].
The safety of the CELLECTRA® device has been studied for over seven years, and these studies support the further development of electroporation as a safe vaccine delivery method [@doi:10.4161/hv.24702].
The temporary formation of pores through electroporation facilitates the successful transportation of macromolecules into cells, allowing cells to robustly take up INO-4800 for the production of an antibody response.
Approved by the United States (U.S.) FDA on April 6, 2020, the phase I study is enrolling up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia, PA at the Perelman School of Medicine and at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, MO.
The trial has two experimental arms corresponding to the two locations.
Participants in Experimental Group 1 will receive one intradermal injection of 1.0 milligram (mg) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device twice, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Participants in Experimental Group 2 will receive two intradermal injections of 1.0 mg (total 2.0 mg per dosing visit) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Safety data and the initial immune responses of participants from the trial are expected by the end of the summer of 2021.
The development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by Inovio could be an important step forward in the world's search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Although exciting, the cost of vaccine manufacturing and electroporation may make scaling the use of this technology for prophylactic use for the general public difficult.

##### Viral-Vectored DNA Vaccines

**Mechanism:**
Plasmids are not the only vector that can be used to deliver sequences associated with viral antigens: genetic material from the target virus can also be delivered using a second virus as a vector.
Viral vectors have emerged as a safe and efficient method to furnish the nucleotide sequences of an antigen to the immune system using a second virus as a vector [@doi:10.1128/CVI.00298-16].
The genetic content of the vector virus is often altered to prevent it from replicating, but replication-competent viruses can also be used under certain circumstances [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.014].
Once the plasmid or viral vector brings the DNA sequence to an APC, the host machinery can be used to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, and the body can then synthesize antibodies in response [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
These vaccines can be either replicating or non-replicating [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2007.10.010].
One of the early viral vectors explored was adenovirus, with serotype 5 (Ad5) being particularly effective [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
This technology rose in popularity during the 2000s due to its being more immunogenic in humans and non-human primates than plasmid-vectored DNA vaccines [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
In the 2000s, interest also arose in utilizing simian adenoviruses as vectors because of the reduced risk that human vaccine recipients would have prior exposure resulting in adaptive immunity [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432; @doi:10.1038/mt.2013.284], and chimpanzee adenoviruses were explored as a potential vector in the development of a vaccine against _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.3390/v12080861].
Today, various viral-vector platforms including poxviruses [@doi:10/cnw6vw; @doi:10.4161/hv.28974], adenoviruses [@doi:10.1038/mt.2009.130], and vesicular stomatitis viruses [@pmid:10196265; @doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2004.03.003] are being developed,
Viral-vector vaccines are able to induce both an antibody and cellular response; however, the response is limited due to the immunogenicity of the viral vector used [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.006; @doi:10.1038/mt.2009.130].
An important consideration in identifying potential vectors is the immune response to the vector.
Both the innate and adaptive immune responses can potentially respond to the vector, limiting the ability of the vaccine to transfer information to the immune system [@doi:10.1038/gt.2009.148].
Different vectors are associated with different levels of reactogenicity; for example, adenoviruses elicit a much stronger innate immune response than replication deficient adeno-associated viruses derived from parvoviruses [@doi:10.1038/gt.2009.148].
Additionally, using a virus circulating widely in human populations as a vector presents additional challenges because vaccine recipients may already have developed an immune response to the vector [@doi:10.3390/vaccines2030624].

**Prior Applications:**
There are several viral vector vaccines that are available for veterinary use [@doi:10.3390/vaccines8040680; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432], but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, only one viral vector vaccine was approved by the FDA for use in humans.
This vaccine is vectored with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus and targeted against the ebola virus [doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.011].
Additionally, several phase I and phase II clinical trials for other vaccines are ongoing [@doi:10.1128/CVI.00298-16], and the technology is currently being explored for its potential against numerous infectious diseases including malaria [@doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.11.003; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.07.035], ebola [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1410863; @doi:10.1093/infdis/jir349; @doi:10.1586/14760584.2014.885841], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [@doi:10.1097/COH.0b013e328363d389; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2014.09.004].
The threat of MERS and SARS initiated interest in the application of viral vector vaccines to human coronaviruses [@doi:10.3390/v12080861], but efforts to apply this technology to these pathogens had not yet led to a successful vaccine candidate.
In the mid-to-late 00s, adenoviral vectored vaccines against SARS were found to induce SARS-CoV-specific IgA in the lungs of mice [@doi:10.1099/vir.0.81579-0], but were later found to offer incomplete protection in ferret models [@doi:10.1099/vir.0.2008/001891-0].
Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow sought to use an adenovirus platform for the development of vaccines for _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ and Ebola virus, although neither of the previous vaccines were internationally licensed [@url:https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2018/october/2_Ebola_SAGE2018Oct_BgDoc_20180919.pdf].

In 2017, results were published from an initial investigation of two vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV containing the MERS-CoV S gene vectored with chimpanzee adenovirus, Oxford University #1 (ChAdOx1), a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.032].
This study reported that a candidate containing the complete spike protein sequence induced a stronger neutralizing antibody response in mice than candidates vectored with modified vaccinia virus Ankara.
It was pursued in additional research, and in the summer of 2020 results of two studies were published.
The first reported that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS induced an immune response and inhibited viral replication in macaques [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba8399].
The second reported  promising results from a phase I trial that administered the vaccine to adults and measured safety/tolerability and immune response (as indicated through immune assays following vaccination) [@doi:10/ggtxgp].

**Application to COVID-19:**
While not all of these results were available at the time that vaccine development programs against SARS-CoV-2 began, at least three viral vector vaccines have also been developed against this hCoV.
First, collaboration between AstraZeneca and researchers at the University of Oxford has successfully applied a viral vector approach to the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using the replication-deficient ChAdOx1 vector modified to encode the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y].
In phase I and I/II trials, respectively, the immunogenic potential of vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was demonstrated through the immune challenge of two animal models, mice and rhesus macaques [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y] and patients receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that peaked by day 28, with these levels remaining stable until a second observation at day 56 [@doi:10/gg5gwk].

Second, a viral vector approach was also applied by Gamaleya to develop Sputnik V, a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vaccine that combines two adenovirus vectors, rAd26-S and rAd5-S, that express the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.
The two vectors are administered intramuscularly administered sequentially, following a prime-boost regimen.
Despite a lack of data from clinical trials, President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced the approval of the Sputnik V vaccines on August 11th, 2020 [@doi:10/ft7j] and it has subsequently been administered in Russia and other countries.

Third, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, also developed a viral vector vaccine in collaboration with and funded by the United States's “Operation Warp Speed” [@url:https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319; @url:https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use].
The vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735, formerly known as Ad26.COV2-S, is a monovalent vaccine that is composed of a replication-deficient adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the stabilized prefusion S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034201;@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x]. 
Unlike the other two viral vector vaccines available to date, JNJ-78436735 requires only a single dose, a characteristic that is expected to aid in global deployment [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2607-z].
JNJ-78436735 was selected from among a number of initial candidate designs [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x] and tested _in vivo_ in Syrian golden hamsters and Rhesus macaques to assess safety and immunogenicity [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2607-z; @doi:10.1038/s41591-020-1070-6; @doi:10.1101/2020.11.17.368258].
The JNJ-78436735 candidate was selected for its favorable immunogenicity profile and ease of manufacturability [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2607-z; @doi:10.1038/s41591-020-1070-6; @doi:10.1101/2020.11.17.368258] and was found to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaques even after six months [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.30.428921].
The one- versus two-dose regimen was tested in volunteers through a phase I/IIa trial [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034201], although these results are not yet available; however, the study did report that the vaccine was well-tolerated and that most participants demonstrated seroconversion in a neutralization assay 29 days after immunization [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034201].

The three viral-vector vaccines described above have demonstrated the potential for this technology to facilitate a quick response to an emerging pathogen.
Additionally, though the vaccines are developed using similar principles, there are some differences that might influence their efficacy as SARS-CoV-2 evolves.
In the Janssen vaccine, the S protein immunogen is stabilized in its prefusion conformation, while in the Sputnik V and AstraZeneca vaccines, it is not.
How these differences in design influence the efficacy of these three viral-vector vaccines over time remains to be seen.

**Efficacy Estimates:**
The first DNA viral-vectored vaccine for which efficacy estimates became available was AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
In December 2020, preliminary results of the phase III trial were released detailing randomized control trials conducted in the U.K., Brazil, and South Africa between April and November 2020 [@doi:10/fmq2].
These trials again compared ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 to a control, but the design of each study varied; pooling data across studies indicated an overall efficacy of 70.4%. <!--To Do: symptomatic?-->

For Sputnik V, the phase III trial indicated an overall vaccine efficacy of 91.6% for symptomatic COVID-19 [@doi:10/ghxj4g].

As for Janssen, the phase III trial is ongoing across several countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, and the U.S.), but interim results were reported in a press release on January 29th, 2021 [@url:https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/janssen-investigational-covid-19-vaccine-interim-analysis-phase-3-clinical-data-released; @url:https://www.janssen.com/emea/sites/www_janssen_com_emea/files/johnson_johnson_announces_single-shot_janssen_covid-19_vaccine_candidate_met_primary_endpoints_in_interim_analysis_of_its_phase_3_ensemble_trial.pdf].<!--Still true?-->
The vaccine was well-tolerated, and across all regions studied, it was found to be 66% effective after 28 days for the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19 and to be 85% effective for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 as well as 100% protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death.

**Distribution Status:**

As of early January, Sputnik V had been administered to as many as 1.5 million Russians [@url:https://www.brusselstimes.com/news-contents/world/149039/1-5-million-people-have-received-sputnik-v-vaccine-russia-says-russian-direct-investment-fund-mikhail-murashko/] , and doses of Sputnik V have also been distributed to other parts of Europe, such as Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary, San Marino, Serbia, and Slovakia [@url:https://www.euronews.com/2021/02/12/hungary-to-begin-using-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-today; @url:https://www.euronews.com/2021/02/24/san-marino-buys-russia-s-sputnik-v-after-eu-vaccine-delivery-delays; @url:https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/12/29/belarus-starts-coronavirus-vaccination-with-sputnik-v-a72512], with the Czech Republic and Austria also having expressed interest in its procurement [@url:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/russias-sputnik-vaccine-is-luring-eastern-europe-worrying-the-eu.html].
It wasn't until February 2021, six months after its approval in Russia, that interim results of the phase III trial were released [@doi:10/ghxj4g].

However, two of the three vaccines have faced a number of criticisms surrounding the implementation of their clinical trials.
<!--To Do: Suggestion to move some of the Sputnik controversy here, along with describing the issues with the AstraZeneca trial-->
<!--To Do: Pre-fusion conformation issues-->

**Variants:**
A range of efficacy estimates were reported for Janssen's vaccine candidate, with estimates varying from 57% in South Africa to 72% in the United States.
These differences suggested that efficacy might be influenced by the prominent viral strains circulating in each country at the time of the trial, since at the time, several variants of concern were being monitored, including B.1.351, which was first identified in South Africa [@url:https://cov-lineages.org/global_report_B.1.351.html].

##### RNA Vaccines

**Mechanism:**
Building on DNA vaccine technology, RNA vaccines are an even more recent advancement for vaccine development.
Interest in messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines emerged around 1990 following _in vitro_ and animal model studies that demonstrated that mRNA could be transferred into cells [@doi:10.1016/j.nantod.2019.100766; @doi:10.4161/rna.22269].
mRNA contains the minimum information needed to create a protein [@doi:10.4161/rna.22269].
RNA vaccines are therefore nucleic-acid based modalities that code for viral antigens against which the human body elicits a humoral and cellular immune response.
This approach operates one level above the DNA: instead of directly furnishing the gene sequence associated with an antigen to the host, it provides the mRNA transcribed from the DNA sequence.
Some of the potential advantages of mRNA compared to DNA include safety, as it cannot be integrated by the host and the half life can be regulated, it avoids any issues of a host immune response against the vector, and it holds the potential to dramatically accelerate vaccine manufacturing and development [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243; @doi:10.4161/rna.22269].<!--To Do: Add 10.1056/NEJMcibr2111445 either here or in mRNA section--><!--To Do: address on line 70: Are these just advantages comparing mRNA vs DNA vaccines? The first citations seems to imply that these are advantages over protein-based vaccines as well (subunit and whole inactivated vaccines).-->

The mRNA technology is transcribed _in vitro_ and delivered to cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNP) [@doi:10.1002/eji.1830230749].
They are recognized by ribosomes _in vivo_ and then translated and modified into functional proteins [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
The resulting intracellular viral proteins are displayed on surface MHC proteins, provoking a strong CD8+ T cell response as well as a CD4+ T cell and B cell-associated antibody responses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Naturally, mRNA is not very stable and can degrade quickly in the extracellular environment or the cytoplasm.
The LNP covering protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation outside of the cell [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006].
Codon optimization to prevent secondary structure formation and modifications of the poly-A tail as well as the 5’ untranslated region to promote ribosomal complex binding can increase mRNA expression in cells.
Furthermore, purifying out double-stranded RNA and immature RNA with FPLC (fast performance liquid chromatography) and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) technology will improve translation of the mRNA in the cell [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].

There are three types of RNA vaccines: non-replicating, _in vivo_ self-replicating, and _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].
Non-replicating mRNA vaccines consist of a simple open reading frame (ORF) for the viral antigen flanked by the 5’ UTR and 3’ poly-A tail.
_In vivo_ self-replicating vaccines encode a modified viral genome derived from single-stranded, positive sense RNA alphaviruses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
The RNA genome encodes the viral antigen along with proteins of the genome replication machinery, including an RNA polymerase.
Structural proteins required for viral assembly are not included in the engineered genome [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Self-replicating vaccines produce more viral antigens over a longer period of time, thereby evoking a more robust immune response [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].
Finally, _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating RNA vaccines limit transfection to dendritic cells.
Dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting immune cells that easily take up mRNA and present fragments of the translated peptide on their MHC proteins, which can then interact with T cell receptors.
Ultimately, primed T follicular helper cells can stimulate germinal center B cells that also present the viral antigen to produce antibodies against the virus [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.004].
These cells are isolated from the patient, grown and transfected _ex vivo_, and reintroduced to the patient [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].

Vaccines based on mRNA delivery confer many advantages over traditional viral vectored vaccines and DNA vaccines.
In comparison to live attenuated viruses, mRNA vaccines are non-infectious and can be synthetically produced in an egg-free, cell-free environment, thereby reducing the risk of a detrimental immune response in the host [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007].
Unlike DNA vaccines, mRNA technologies are naturally degradable and non-integrating, and they do not need to cross the nuclear membrane in addition to the plasma membrane for their effects to be seen [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Furthermore, mRNA vaccines are easily, affordably, and rapidly scalable.
Although mRNA vaccines have been developed for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, none have previously been licensed or commercialized.
Nevertheless, they have shown promise in animal models and preliminary clinical trials for several indications, including rabies, coronavirus, influenza, and cytomegalovirus [@clinicaltrials:NCT01669096].
Preclinical data previously identified effective antibody generation against full-length FPLC-purified influenza hemagglutinin stalk-encoding mRNA in mice, rabbits, and ferrets [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05482-0].
Similar immunological responses for mRNA vaccines were observed in humans in Phase I and II clinical trials operated by the pharmaceutical-development companies Curevac and Moderna for rabies, flu, and zika [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
Positively charged bilayer LNPs carrying the mRNA attract negatively charged cell membranes, endocytose into the cytoplasm [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006], and facilitate endosomal escape.
LNPs can be coated with modalities recognized and engulfed by specific cell types, and LNPs that are 150 nm or less effectively enter into lymphatic vessels [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06936-1].
Therefore, this technology holds great potential for targeted delivery of modified mRNA.

**Prior Applications:**
mRNA vaccine technology was even slower to develop due to challenges related to the instability of mRNA molecules, the design requirements of an efficient delivery system, and the potential for mRNA to elicit either a very strong immune response or to stimulate the immune system in secondary ways [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.24; @doi:10.3390/vaccines7020037].
<!-- To Do: development of this tech during previous epidemics?-->
As of the 2010s, mRNA was still considered a promising technology for future advances in vaccine development [@doi:10.4161/rna.22269], but prior to 2020, no mRNA vaccines had been approved for use in humans, despite significant advances in the development of this technology [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Therefore, while these technologies elegantly capitalize on decades of research in vaccine development as well as the tools of the genomic revolution, it was largely unknown prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic whether this potential could be realized in a real-world vaccination effort.

**Application to COVID-19:**
Given the potential for this technology to be quickly adapted for a new pathogen, it has held significant interest for the treatment of COVID-19.
In the vaccines developed under this approach, the mRNA coding for a stabilized prefusion spike protein, which is immunogenic [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], can be furnished to the immune system in order to train its response.
Two vaccine candidates in this category emerged with promising phase III results at the end of 2020.
Both require two doses approximately one month apart.
The first was Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, which contains the full prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a vaccine formulation based on modified mRNA (modRNA) technology [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a014035; @url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-early-positive-data-ongoing-0].
<!--To Do: brief history of phase I & phase II (like 1-2 sentences)-->
mRNA-1273 is comprised by a conventional lipid nanoparticle encapsulated RNA encoding a full-length prefusion stabilized S protein for SARS-CoV-2 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04283461].
In the phase I trial, neutralizing activity reached similar levels to that observed in convalescent plasma samples by day 7 after the second dose of RNA-1273 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].

**Efficacy Estimates:**
In the phase II/III multinational trial, this vaccine was associated with a 95% efficacy against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with mild-to-moderate local and systemic effects but a low risk of serious adverse effects [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577].
Similarly, ModernaTX developed mRNA-1273, which, despite being the second mRNA vaccine to release phase III results, was the first mRNA vaccine to enter phase I clinical trials.
A few months later, interim results from the phase III trial indicated 94.5% efficacy of the vaccine in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults who received the vaccine at 99 sites around the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
Similar to BNT162b2, the vaccine was associated with mild-to-moderate adverse effects but with a low risk of serious adverse events [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389]. 
In late 2020, both vaccines both received approval from the United States's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19; @url:https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm], and these vaccines have been widely distributed, primarily in North America and the European Union [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].
As the first mRNA vaccines to make it to market, these two highly efficacious vaccines demonstrate the power of this emerging technology, which has previously attracted scientific interest because of its potential to be used to treat non-infectious as well as infectious diseases.

Between December 2020 and April 2021, one prospective cohort study obtained weekly nasal swabs from 3,975 individuals at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (health care workers, frontline workers, etc.) within the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107058].
Among these participants, 3,179 (80%) had received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine and 2,686 (84%) were fully vaccinated.
For each vaccinated participant (defined here as having received at least dose 1 more than 7 days ago) whose sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, they categorized the viral lineage(s) present in the sample as well as in samples from 3-4 unvaccinated individuals matched by site and testing date.
Overall efficacy of mRNA vaccines was estimated at 91% with full vaccination, similar to the reports from the clinical trials.
The occurrence of fevers was also lower in individuals who were partially or fully vaccinated, and the duration of symptoms was approximately 6 days shorter.

Several trials have faced pauses while adverse events were investigated.
In most cases, these events were determined not to be related to the vaccine.
For the whole-virus vaccines, CoronaVac has now been approved despite some halts due to reports of adverse reactions [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/sinovac-covid-19-vaccine.html], and a trial of the SinoPharm WIV04 vaccine in Peru was briefly paused due to safety concerns in relation to neurological symptoms [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/16/world/covid-19-coronavirus#the-clinical-trials-of-a-chinese-vaccine-resume-in-peru-after-a-volunteers-illness-is-deemed-unrelated], but this was later deemed unrelated to the vaccine, and the trial continued [@clinicaltrials:NCT04612972].

### Efficacy Estimates

Efficacy estimates have been released for many vaccine candidates across a number of technology types.
However, efficacy is not a static value, and real-world efficacy can vary with location and over time.
Temporal shifts in efficacy have been a especially heightened topic of concern in late 2021 given the potential for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to influence vaccine efficacy.
The original efficacy estimates are outlined in Table XX and additional considerations for each vaccine type are described in more detail below.

| Technology  | Platform                   | Size of Efficacy Population (N)  | Estimated Efficacy | Source                             |

### Special Populations

CoronaVac appears to be suitable for use in immunocompromised patients such as those with autoimmune rheumatic diseases according to phase IV trials [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01469-5].
CoronaVac was also well tolerated and induced humoral responses in phase I trials in children aged 3 to 17 years, which will now be examined in phase II and III clinical trials [@doi:10/gn93].
<!--Quick summary of other trials in children, are all of them analyzing elderly?-->

### Effect of Vaccines on Community Spread

<!--- Add a paragraph explaining why they have the bonus of reducing community spread -->

The vaccine clinical trial data demonstrate a significant reduction in the likelihood of contracting symptomatic COVID-19, thereby succeeding in the primary goal of vaccination.
The mRNA vaccines in particular are so effective in preventing severe disease and death that it is also worth considering whether they might reduce disease transmission, given that vaccination rates are unlikely to reach 100%.
This question hinges on whether vaccinated individuals with or without symptoms of COVID-19 can still spread SARS-CoV-2.
This question is made up of several components.
The crux is whether vaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptom status, are as contagious as unvaccinated, infected individuals.
Additionally, as outlined above, an important qualification is that the variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating at the time of each study must be considered in light of the effect of evolution on vaccine efficacy.

The phase 2/3 clinical trials evaluating the mRNA vaccines assessed vaccine efficacy based on COVID-19 diagnosis, thereby detecting only patients who received a diagnosis.
In order to identify patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who did not receive a diagnosis, for example, potentially those who did not develop symptoms, it would be necessary to conduct routine PCR testing even in the absence of symptoms.
Prior to the development of vaccines, the evidence suggested that asymptomatic individuals could still spread SARS-CoV-2.
Investigation of viral dynamics of asymptomatic infection in early 2020 indicated that asymptomatic patients continued to shed the virus for a duration similar to that of symptomatic patients [@doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.030] (although viral shedding should not be conflated with contagiousness without further investigation [@individual-pathogenesis]).
Another study found viral load to be higher in the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples of asymptomatic patients compared to symptomatic patients hospitalized due to symptoms and/or known exposure [@doi:10.1007/s15010-020-01548-8].
However, the sample size in both of these studies was small, and a larger study found higher viral load in symptomatic than asymptomatic cases [@doi:10.3390/v13020304] along with a systematic review finding a reduced probability of asymptomatic transmission [@doi:10.3138/jammi-2020-0030].
While far from conclusive, these studies suggest that asymptomatic cases still cary a risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2.

One important consideration is therefore how likely vaccinated individuals are to develop asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2.
Considering asymptomatic cases is necessary to establish a more complete picture of efficacy with respect to spread.<!-- To Do: Possible figure indicating pyramid of risk with and without vaccines?-->
Routine testing of healthcare workers in California who had received an mRNA vaccine revealed slightly higher rates of absolute risk for testing positive than those identified in the phase 2/3 trials, although the extent to which asymptomatic infection influenced these numbers was not investigated [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2101927].
Another study analyzed the results of COVID-19 screening tests administered to asymptomatic individuals prior to receiving certain medical services at the Mayo Clinic in several locations across the United States.
This study found patients who had received two doses of an mRNA vaccine to be 73% less likely to have asymptomatic COVID-19 than patients who had received zero doses [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciab229].
Because this study began on December 17, 2020, a date selected to coincide with the first day vaccines were available at the Mayo Clinic, this number may underestimate the efficacy of the vaccines given that many people eligible for early vaccination were at increased risk for exposure (e.g., healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities) [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciab229/6167855].
In Israel, a longitudinal study of nearly 12,000 healthcare workers found that of the 5,372 fully vaccinated people with Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, 8 developed symptomatic COVID-19 (BNT162b2 (.15%) and 19 developed asymptomatic COVID-19 (.35%) [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.7152].
While the study itself analyzed the efficacy of the vaccine based on person-days, these findings also suggest that many or even the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in vaccinated individuals are likely to be asymptomatic.
Therefore, in addition to the symptomatic cases reported by the vaccine clinical trials, these findings suggest that asymptomatic cases can also occur in vaccinated people.
In the absence of symptoms, individuals are less likely to know to self-isolate, and therefore evaluating the effect of the vaccine on viral load is critical to understanding the role vaccinated individuals can play in spreading SARS-CoV-2.

Another question of interest is therefore whether vaccinated individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 carry a similar viral load to unvaccinated individuals.
Viral load is often approximated by cycle threshold (C~t~), or the cycle at which viral presence is detected during RT-qPCR, with a lower C~t~ corresponding to a greater viral load. 
A prospective cohort study that evaluated front-line workers in six U.S. states from December 2020 to April 2021 reported a 40% reduction in viral load even with just a single dose of an mRNA vaccine [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2107058].
The vaccine also appeared to influence the time to viral clearance: the risk of having detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 for more than one week was reduced by 66% in participants who had received at least one dose [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2107058].
However, this study compared the mean viral load across the two groups, meaning that these findings cannot be extrapolated across all points in the disease course.
Similarly, between December 2020 and February 2021, positive RT-qPCR tests were analyzed for almost 5,000 Israeli patients [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01316-7].
C~t~ was analyzed relative to when each patient received the first dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
A sharp increase in C~t~ (corresponding to reduced viral load) was observed between days 11 and 12, consistent with what is known about the onset of immunity following vaccination.
This pattern therefore suggested a direct effect of vaccination on viral load.

Other studies, however, have not offered support for a reduced viral load in breakthrough cases.
In Singapore, which has strict protocols for screening individuals with potential COVID-19 exposure, a retrospective cohort of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between April and June 2021 was analyzed to compare viral kinetics and symptom course between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases.
Vaccinated individuals who tested positive experienced fewer symptoms than unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and were more likely to be asymptomatic [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295] (Appendix).
Additionally, this study analyzed C~t~ over time and found that, though the median values were similar between the two groups at disease onset, viral load appeared to decrease more rapidly in vaccinated cases [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295] (Appendix).
This study is likely to have evaluated a more accurate representation of all COVID-19 outcomes than has been feasible in most studies, but one limitation was that the RT-PCR reactions were conducted in many different facilities.
A third study investigated viral load (as approximated by C~t~) using samples processed in a single laboratory during the summer of 2021 [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.31.21261387].
This study identified no significant differences in C~t~ between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated cases, but this study used samples sent for diagnosis and was not longitudinal.
It offered the additional benefit of culturing samples to assess whether their C~t~ threshold was likely to represent contagiousness and found that SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured from 51 of 55 samples with C~t~ less than 25 (the cut-off used in many studies).
Another study of samples collected at two sites in San Francisco, one of which tested only asymptomatic individuals, reported no difference in C~t~ between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases regardless of whether vaccination status was included in the model [@doi:10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262].
Though each of these three studies offers distinct strengths and weaknesses, taken together, they suggest that viral load is likely to be similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, but that vaccinated individuals clear the virus more rapidly, meaning that the average viral load is lower over time.

Given the emergence of variants of concern, especially the Delta variant, for which breakthrough infections are more common, the potential for vaccinated individuals to spread SARS-CoV-2 is not necessarily static over time.
In fact, studies reporting reduced viral load in vaccinated individuals collected samples, for the most part, prior to the emergence of the Delta variant's dominance.
<!-- Check this when writing section about vaccines & delta. Also add a sentence about different mRNA vaccines and different efficacy wrt Delta-->
The emergence of this variant may partially account for why more recent studies tend to find no difference between viral load in vaccinated and unvaccinated cases.

Taken together, these findings can provide some insight into how vaccines influence community spread.
While vaccinated individuals may be more likely to experience asymptomatic infection, current evidence about viral load in asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases is ambiguous.
Similarly, no conclusions can be drawn about whether viral load is different in vaccinated versus unvaccinated cases.
Therefore, at present, the evidence suggests that vaccinated individuals who are infected can still contribute to community spread.
The one potential mitigating factor supported at present is that differences in the viral kinetics may result in vaccinated cases infecting fewer individuals over time due to a more rapid decrease in viral load [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295], although this study did not examine patterns in secondary transmission.
Thus, the virological evidence suggests that public health measures such as masking and distancing remain important even in areas with high vaccination rates.

#### Other Concerns in Efficacy

Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.

Age distribution in clinical trials? https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2021.101455

Concerns: diversity of volunteer pools, variants, and distribution
Another benefit of vaccines is lower population size in SARS-CoV-2 = less risk of VOC emerging that are less susceptible to the vaccine

Given the apparent need for boosters, interest has also emerged in whether vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 can be administered along with annual flu vaccines.
Early data came from the Novavax NVX-CoV2373 protein subunit vaccine.
In a subgroup of approximately 400 patients enrolled from the U.K. phase III trial who received either NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 1:1, a concomitant dose of adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (either a trivalent vaccine or a quadrivalent vaccine) was administered [@doi:10.1101/2021.06.09.21258556]. 
This study demonstrated that both types of vaccines could be safely administered together. 
While no change to the immune response was noted for the influenza vaccine, a notable reduction of the antibody response for the NVX-CoV2373 was reported, but efficacy was still high at 87.5% [@doi:10.1101/2021.06.09.21258556].
Novavax has since started phase I/II trials to investigate the administration of its own influenza vaccine, NanoFlu^™^, concomitantly with NVX-CoV2373 [@url:https://ir.novavax.com/2021-09-08-Novavax-Initiates-Phase-1-2-Clinical-Trial-of-Combination-Vaccine-for-COVID-19-and-Seasonal-Influenza], which appeared to be safe and effective in preclinical studies [@doi:10.1101/2021.05.05.442782].
