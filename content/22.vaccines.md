### COVAXIN/BBV152

India, the biggest producer of vaccines globally, has developed COVAXIN®, which is an indigenous COVID-19 vaccine researched and manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). 
Bharat Biotech reported 80.6% vaccine efficacy for its whole virion inactivated  BBV152 (COVAXIN®) vaccine candidate in 25,800 participants in phase III clinical trials [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/images/press/covaxin-phase3-efficacy-results.pdf; @url:https://www.biogenetech.co.th/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-Ocugen.pdf]. 
It was reported in _The Lancet_ that the BBV152 vaccine candidate adjuvanted with alum and a Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist is safe, immunogenic, and induces Th1-skewed memory T-cell responses upon immunization [@doi:10/gh7597].
Importantly, sera from individuals vaccinated with COVAXIN^®^ efficiently neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant and the heterologous strain of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.26.426986].
U.S.-based Ocugen Inc., a  co-development partner of Bharat Biotech, is leading the application for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVAXIN™ intended for the U.S. market. 
As of April 1, 2021 COVAXIN® has been approved for emergency use in Iran, Zimbabwe, and Nepal, and Mauritius and Paraguay have received a commercial supply of the vaccine.
In Asia, China and India are the main COVID-19 vaccination developers and providers.
Thus far, over 63 million people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in India [@url:https://www.mygov.in/covid-19/].
A broad range of COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under investigation in order to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In India, the Covaxin vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech received emergency authorization on January 3rd, 2021, despite the lack of phase III data until March 3rd [@url:india-covid-19-vaccine.html; @url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/images/press/covaxin-phase3-efficacy-results.pdf].
Following the release of the phase III data indicating 81% efficacy, Zimbabwe authorized the use of Covaxin [@url:http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-03/04/c_139783893.htm].
In addition to COVAXIN®, Bharat Biotech has also developed an adenovirus vector-based intranasal BBV154 vaccine candidate that induces neutralizing IgG, mucosal IgA, and T cell responses [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/intranasal-vaccine.html]. 
In February, 2021, Bharat Biotech received approval from Indian officials to commence a phase I study of an intranasal chimpanzee-adenovirus (ChAd) vectored SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine called BBV154 [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/intranasal-vaccine.html]. 
Another Indian pharmaceutical industry, Zydus Cadila is developing India’s first indiginous DNA vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.26.428240]  which has completed phase I and II clinical trials and has received an approval from Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct a phase III clinical trial [@url:https://vaccine.icmr.org.in/covid-19-vaccine].
Moreover, Indian-based Biological E.Limited has partnered with U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company Dynavax Technologies Corporation and Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, to initiate a phase I/II clinical trial in India for its COVID-19 subunit vaccine, which consists of the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [@url:https://vaccine.icmr.org.in/covid-19-vaccine]. 
Notably, Novavax has signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India allowing them to produce up to 2 billion doses a year [@url:https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax-idUSKBN2661PI].
Novavax has also signed agreements with the U.K., Canada, Australia, and South Korea [@url:https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement] and has projected that they will supply 1.1 billion doses to COVAX who will distribute the vaccines to countries with disadvantaged access to vaccine supplies [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].
India has vaccinated approximately 24 million people [@url:https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/].
This has been achieved by mainly using the AstraZeneca-University of Oxford vaccine, known as Covishield in India, which is also produced by the Serum Institute of India, and using India’s own Covaxin vaccine [@url:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124].
India has also shipped approximately 58 million COVID-19 vaccines to 66 countries [@url:https://www.mea.gov.in/vaccine-supply.htm]
Considering India produces approximately 60% of the world's vaccines prior to the pandemic, it is no surprise that several other vaccine candidates are under development.
These include ZyCov-Di, a DNA vaccine produced by Zydus Cadila, HGCO19, India’s first mRNA vaccine produced by Genova and HDT Biotech Corporation (of the U.S.), and the Bio E subunit vaccine produced by Biological E in collaboration with U.S.-based Dynavax and the Baylor College of Medicine [@url:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124].
