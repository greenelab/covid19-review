## Vaccine Development Strategies for SARS-CoV-2

### Abstract

### Importance

### Introduction

For a highly infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2, a vaccine would hold particular value because it could bolster the immune response to the virus of the population broadly, thereby driving a lower rate of infection and likely significantly reducing fatalities.
However, the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].

Flu-like illnesses caused by viruses are a common target of vaccine development programs, and influenza vaccine technology in particular has made many strides.
During the H1N1 influenza outbreak, vaccine development was accelerated because of the existing infrastructure, along with the fact that regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the production and distribution of the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

**Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.**
The development of vaccines depends on the immune system recognizing the virus.
Here, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is represented both in the abstract and against a visualization of the virion.<!--To Do: Add in-line ref-->
The abstracted visualization was made using BioRender [@url:https://biorender.com/] and the microscopy was done by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [@url:https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/novel-coronavirus-sarscov2-images].

The first critical step towards developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was characterizing the target, which fortunately happened early in the COVID-19 outbreak with the sequencing and dissemination of the viral genome [@url:https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/].
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of September 2020, there were over 180 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in development [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].
Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies.
Experience in the field of oncology is encouraging COVID-19 vaccine developers to use next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152].
These diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus, and inactivated virus approaches (Figure @fig:vaccines).
Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.
The requirements for a successful vaccine trial and deployment are complex and may require coordination between government, industry, academia, and philanthropic entities [@doi:10.1126/science.abc5312].
While little is currently known about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development typically tests for serum neutralizing activity, as this has been established as a biomarker for adaptive immunity in other respiratory illnesses [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].

**Vaccine Development Strategies.**
Several different strategies can and are being employed for the development of vaccines.
Each approach capitalizes on different features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and delivery through a different platform.

### DNA Vaccines

This vaccination method involves the direct introduction of a plasmid containing a DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought into appropriate tissues [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/].
This approach may offer several advantages over traditional vaccination approaches, such as the stimulation of both B- as well as T-cell responses and the absence of any infectious agent.

#### INO-4800 Vaccine

Currently, a Phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of INO-4800, a prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, is underway [@clinicaltrials:NCT04336410].
The vaccine developer Inovio Pharmaceuticals Technology is overseeing administration of INO-4800 by intradermal injection followed by electroporation with the CELLECTRA® device to healthy volunteers.
Electroporation is the application of brief electric pulses to tissues in order to permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner.
It has been shown that electroporation can enhance vaccine efficacy by up to 100-fold, as measured by increases in antigen-specific antibody titers [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.008].
The safety of the CELLECTRA® device has been studied for over seven years, and these studies support the further development of electroporation as a safe vaccine delivery method [@doi:10.4161/hv.24702].
The temporary formation of pores through electroporation facilitates the successful transportation of macromolecules into cells, allowing cells to robustly take up INO-4800 for the production of an antibody response.
Approved by the U.S. FDA on April 6, 2020, the Phase I study is enrolling up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia, PA at the Perelman School of Medicine and at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, MO.
The trial has two experimental arms corresponding to the two locations.
Participants in Experimental Group 1 will receive one intradermal injection of 1.0 milligram (mg) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device twice, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Participants in Experimental Group 2 will receive two intradermal injections of 1.0 mg (total 2.0 mg per dosing visit) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Safety data and the initial immune responses of participants from the trial are expected by the end of the summer of 2021.
The development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by Inovio could be an important step forward in the world's search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Although exciting, the cost of vaccine manufacturing and electroporation may make scaling the use of this technology for prophylactic use for the general public difficult.

### RNA Vaccines

RNA vaccines are nucleic-acid based modalities that code for viral antigens against which the human body elicits a humoral and cellular immune response.
The mRNA technology is transcribed _in vitro_ and delivered to cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNP) [@doi:10.1002/eji.1830230749].
They are recognized by ribosomes _in vivo_ and then translated and modified into functional proteins [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
The resulting intracellular viral proteins are displayed on surface MHC proteins, provoking a strong CD8+ T cell response as well as a CD4+ T cell and B cell-associated antibody responses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Naturally, mRNA is not very stable and can degrade quickly in the extracellular environment or the cytoplasm.
The LNP covering protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation outside of the cell [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006].
Codon optimization to prevent secondary structure formation and modifications of the poly-A tail as well as the 5’ untranslated region to promote ribosomal complex binding can increase mRNA expression in cells.
Furthermore, purifying out double-stranded RNA and immature RNA with FPLC (fast performance liquid chromatography) and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) technology will improve translation of the mRNA in the cell [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
Vaccines based on mRNA delivery confer many advantages over traditional viral vectored vaccines and DNA vaccines.
In comparison to live attenuated viruses, mRNA vaccines are non-infectious and can be synthetically produced in an egg-free, cell-free environment, thereby reducing the risk of a detrimental immune response in the host [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007].
Unlike DNA vaccines, mRNA technologies are naturally degradable and non-integrating, and they do not need to cross the nuclear membrane in addition to the plasma membrane for their effects to be seen [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Furthermore, mRNA vaccines are easily, affordably, and rapidly scalable.

Although mRNA vaccines have been developed for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, none have previously been licensed or commercialized.
Nevertheless, they have shown promise in animal models and preliminary clinical trials for several indications, including rabies, coronavirus, influenza, and cytomegalovirus [@clinicaltrials:NCT01669096].
Preclinical data previously identified effective antibody generation against full-length FPLC-purified influenza hemagglutinin stalk-encoding mRNA in mice, rabbits, and ferrets [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05482-0].
Similar immunological responses for mRNA vaccines were observed in humans in Phase I and II clinical trials operated by the pharmaceutical-development companies Curevac and Moderna for rabies, flu, and zika [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
Positively charged bilayer LNPs carrying the mRNA attract negatively charged cell membranes, endocytose into the cytoplasm [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006], and facilitate endosomal escape.
LNPs can be coated with modalities recognized and engulfed by specific cell types, and LNPs that are 150 nm or less effectively enter into lymphatic vessels [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06936-1].
Therefore, this technology holds great potential for targeted delivery of modified mRNA.

There are three types of RNA vaccines: non-replicating, _in vivo_ self-replicating, and _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].
Non-replicating mRNA vaccines consist of a simple open reading frame (ORF) for the viral antigen flanked by the 5’ UTR and 3’ poly-A tail.
_In vivo_ self-replicating vaccines encode a modified viral genome derived from single-stranded, positive sense RNA alphaviruses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
The RNA genome encodes the viral antigen along with proteins of the genome replication machinery, including an RNA polymerase.
Structural proteins required for viral assembly are not included in the engineered genome [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Self-replicating vaccines produce more viral antigens over a longer period of time, thereby evoking a more robust immune response [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].
Finally, _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating RNA vaccines limit transfection to dendritic cells.
Dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting immune cells that easily take up mRNA and present fragments of the translated peptide on their MHC proteins, which can then interact with T cell receptors.
Ultimately, primed T follicular helper cells can stimulate germinal center B cells that also present the viral antigen to produce antibodies against the virus [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.004].
These cells are isolated from the patient, grown and transfected _ex vivo_, and reintroduced to the patient [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].

Given the potential for this technology to be quickly adapted for a new pathogen, it has held significant interest for the treatment of COVID-19.
In the vaccines developed under this approach, the spike protein, which is immunogenic [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], can be furnished to the immune system in order to train its response.
The vaccine candidates developed against SARS-CoV-2 using mRNA vectors utilize similar principles and technologies, although there are slight differences in implementation among candidates such as the formulation of the platform and the specific components of the spike protein encapsulated (e.g., the full Spike protein vs. the RBD alone) [@doi:10.3389/fphar.2020.00937].
The results of the interim analyses of two mRNA vaccine candidates became available at the end of 2020 and provided strong support for this emerging approach to vaccination.
Below we describe the results available as of February 2021 for two such candidates, mRNA-1273 produced by ModernaTX and BNT162b2 produced by Pfizer, Inc. and BioNTech.

#### ModernaTX mRNA Vaccine

ModernaTX's mRNA-1273 vaccine, which is an  was the first COVID-19 vaccine to enter a phase I clinical trial in the United States.
In this trial, Moderna spearheaded an investigation on the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273, a conventional lipid nanoparticle encapsulated RNA encoding a full-length prefusion stabilized S protein for SARS-CoV-2 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04283461].
An initial report described the results of enrolling forty-five participants who were administered intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 in their deltoid muscle on day 1 and day 29, and then followed for the next twelve months [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].
Healthy males and non-pregnant females aged 18-55 years were recruited for this study and divided into three groups receiving 25, 100, or 250 micrograms (&mu;g) of mRNA-1273.
IgG ELISA assays on patient serology samples were used to examine the immunogenicity of the vaccine [@clinicaltrials:NCT04283461].
Binding antibodies were observed at two weeks after the first dose at all concentrations.
At the time point one week after the second dose was administered on day 29, the pseudotyped lentivirus reporter single-round-of-infection neutralization assay (PsVNA), which was used to assess neutralizing activity, reached a median level similar to the median observed in convalescent plasma samples.
Participants reported mild and moderate systemic adverse events after the day 1 injection, and one severe local event was observed in each of the two highest dose levels.
The second injection led to severe systemic adverse events for three of the participants at the highest dose levels, with one participant in the group being evaluated at an urgent care center on the day after the second dose.
The reported localized adverse events from the second dose were similar to those from the first.

Several months later, a press release from ModernaTX described the results of the first interim analysis of the vaccine [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy].
On November 16, 2020, a report was released describing the initial results from Phase III testing, corresponding to the first 95 cases of COVID-19 in the 30,000 enrolled participants [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy], with additional data released to the FDA on December 17, 2020 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-december-17-2020-meeting-announcement#event-materials].
These results were subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal (_The New England Journal of Medicine_) on December 30, 2020 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
The first group of 30,420 study participants were randomized to receive the vaccine or a placebo at a ratio of 1:1 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
Administration occurred at 99 sites within the United States in two sessions, spaced 28 days apart [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
Patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms upon follow-up were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab that was evaluated with RT-PCR [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
The initial preliminary analysis reported the results of the cases observed up until a cut-off date of November 11, 2020.
Of these first 95 cases reported, 90 occurred in participants receiving the placebo compared to 5 cases in the group receiving the vaccine [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy].
These results suggested the vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19.
Additionally, eleven severe cases of COVID-19 were observed, and all eleven occurred in participants receiving the placebo.
The publication reported the results through an extended cut-off date of November 21, 2020, corresponding to 196 cases [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
Of these, 11 occurred in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group, corresponding to an efficacy of 94.1%.
Once again, all of the severe cases of COVID-19 observed (n=30) occurred in the placebo group, including one death.
Thus, as more cases are reported, the efficacy of the vaccine has remained above 90%, and no cases of severe COVID-19 have yet been reported in participants receiving the vaccine.

These findings suggest the possibility that the vaccine might bolster immune defenses even for subjects who do still develop a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The study was designed with an explicit goal of including individuals at high risk for COVID-19, including older adults, people with underlying health conditions, and people of color [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-has-completed-case-accrual-first-planned-interim].
The Phase III trial population was comprised by approximately 25.3% adults over age 65 in the initial report and 24.8% in the publication [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
Among the cases reported by both interim analyses, 16-17% occurred in older adults [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389]..
Additionally, approximately 10% of participants identified a Black or African-American background and 20% identified Hispanic or Latino ethnicity [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
Among the first 95 cases, 12.6% occurred in participants identifying a Hispanic or Latino background and 4% in participants reporting a Black or African-American background [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy]; in the publication, they indicated only that 41 of the cases reported in the placebo group and 1 case in the treatment group occurred in "communities of color", corresponding to 21.4% of all cases [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
While the sample size in both analyses is small relative to the study population of over 30,000, these results suggest that the vaccine is likely to be effective in people from a variety of backgrounds.
By all indications, this vaccine is likely to be highly useful in mitigating the damage of SARS-CoV-2.

In-depth safety data was released by ModernaTX as part of their application for an EUA from the FDA and summarized in the associated publication [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389; @url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
Because the detail provided in the report is greater than that provided in the publication, here we emphasize the results observed at the time of the first analysis.
Overall, a large percentage of participants reported adverse effects when solicited, and these reports were higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (94.5% versus 59.5%, respectively, at the time of the initial analysis) [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
Some of these events met the criteria for grade 3 (local or systemic) or grade 4 (systemic only) toxicity [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download], but most were grade 1 or grade 2 and lasted 2-3 days [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
The most common local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site, reported by 83.7% of participants receiving the first dose of the vaccine and 88.4% upon receiving the second dose, compared to 19.8% and 19.8% and 17.0%, respectively, of patients in the placebo condition [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
Fewer than 5% of vaccine recipients reported grade 3 pain at either administration.
Other frequent local reactions included erythema, swelling, and lymphadenopathy [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
For systemic adverse reactions, fatigue was the most common [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
Among participants receiving either dose of the vaccine, 68.5% reported fatigue compared to 36.1% participants receiving the placebo [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download].
The level of fatigue experienced was usually fairly mild, with only 9.6% and 1.3% of participants in the vaccine and placebo conditions, respectively, reporting grade 3 fatigue [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download], which corresponds to significant interference with daily activity [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download].
Based on the results of the report, an EUA was issued on December 18, 2020 to allow distribution of this vaccine in the United States [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm], and it was shortly followed by an Interim Order authorizing distribution of the vaccine in Canada [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/health-canada-authorizes-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-canada] and a conditional marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency to facilitate distribution in the European Union [@url:https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-recommends-covid-19-vaccine-moderna-authorisation-eu].

#### Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2

ModernaTX was, in fact, the second company to release news of a successful interim analysis of an mRNA vaccine and receive an EUA.
The first report came from Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 on November 9, 2020 [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against], and a preliminary report was published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ one month later [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577].
The vaccine candidate is contains the full prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a vaccine formulation based on modified mRNA (modRNA) technology [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a014035; @url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-early-positive-data-ongoing-0].
This vaccine candidate should not be confused with a similar candidate from Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b1, that delivered only the RBD of the spike protein [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2639-4; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2814-7], which was not advanced to a stage III trial because of the improved reactogenicity/immunogenicity profile of BNT162b2 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2027906].

During the Phase III trial of BNT162b2, 43,538 participants were enrolled 1:1 in the placebo and the vaccine candidate and received two 30-μg doses 21 days apart [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577].
Of these enrolled participants, 21,720 received BNT162b2 and 21,728 received a placebo [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577].
Recruitment occurred at 135 sites across six countries: Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States.
An initial press release described the first 94 cases, which were consistent with 90% efficacy of the vaccine at 7 days following the second dose [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against].
The release of the full trial information covered a longer period and analyzed the first 170 cases occurring at least 7 days after the second dose, 8 of which occurred in patients who had received BNT162b2.
The press release characterized the study population as diverse, reporting that 42% of the participants worldwide came from non-white backgrounds, including 10% Black and 26% Hispanic or Latino [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine].
Within the United States, 10% and 13% of participants, respectively, identified themselves as having Black or Hispanic/Latino backgrounds [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine].
Additionally, 41% of participants worldwide were 56 years of age or older [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine], and they reported that the efficacy of the vaccine in adults over 65 was 94% [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine].
The primary efficacy analysis of the Phase III study was concluded on November 18, 2020 [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine], and the final results indicted 94.6% efficacy of the vaccine [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577]v.

The safety profile of the vaccine was also assessed [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577].
A subset of patients were followed for reactogenicity using electronic diaries, with the data collected from these 8,183 participants comprising the solicited safety events analyzed.
Much like those who received the ModernaTX vaccine candidate, a large proportion of participants reported experiencing site injection pain within 7 days of vaccination.
While percentages are broken down by age group in the publication, these proportions correspond to approximately 78% and 73% of all participants after the first and second doses, respectively, overall.
Only a small percentage of these events (less than 1%) were rated as serious, with the rest being mild or moderate, and none reached grade 4.
Some participants also reported redness or swelling, and the publication indicates that in most cases, such events resolved within 1 to 2 days.
Participants also experienced systemic effects, including fever (in most cases lower than 38.9°C and more common after dose 2), fatigue (25-50% of participants depending on age group and dose), headache (25-50% of participants depending on age group and dose), chills, and muscle or joint pain; more rarely, patients could experience gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting or diarrhea.
As with the local events, these events were almost always grade I or II.
While some events were reported by the placebo groups, these events were much rarer than in the treatment group even though compliance was similar.
Based on the efficacy and safety information released, the vaccine was approved in early December by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency with administration outside of a clinical trial beginning on December 8, 2020 [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m4714; @url:https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55227325].
As of December 11, 2020, the United States FDA approved this vaccine under an emergency use authorization [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19].

### Viral Vector Vaccines

<!---- #### COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca --->

#### Sputnik-V (Gam-COVID-Vac and Gam-COVID-Vac-Lyo)

The vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac, nicknamed Sputnik V in reference to the space race, was developed by the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow. 
Gamaleya is an organization with prior experience using the adenovirus platform for the development of vaccines for _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ and Ebola virus, although neither of the previous vaccines were internationally licensed [@url:https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2018/october/2_Ebola_SAGE2018Oct_BgDoc_20180919.pdf].
The development of Sputnik V was financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund [@doi:10/ft7j; @doi:10/ghs3sn]. 
Sputnik V is a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vaccine that combines two adenovirus vectors, rAd26-S and rAd5-S, that express the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. 
These vectors are intramuscularly administered individually using two separate vaccines in a prime-boost regimen. 
The rAd26-S is administered first, followed by rAd5-S 21 days later.
Both vaccines deliver 10^11^ viral particles per dose. 
This approach is designed to overcome any potential pre-existing immunity to adenovirus in the population [@doi:10/ghx7xz], as some individuals may possess immunity to Ad5 [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.025].
Sputnik V is the only recombinant adenovirus vaccine to utilize two vectors.
Other vaccines, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, utilize the chimpanzee adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) for both doses [@doi:10/ghpghz].
The Sputnik V vaccines are available in both a lyophilized (Gam-COVID-Vac-Lyo) and frozen form (Gam-COVID-Vac), which are stored at 2-8°C and -18°C respectively [@doi:10/gg96hq]. 
The lyophilized vaccine is convenient for distribution and storage, particularly to remote or disadvantaged areas [@doi:10.3390/v13010054].

In the race to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced the approval of the Sputnik V vaccines on August 11th, 2020 in the absence of clinical evidence [@doi:10/ft7j]. 
Consequently, many international scientific agencies and public health bodies expressed concern that due diligence to the clinical trial process was subverted for the sake of expediency, leading many to question the safety and efficacy of Sputnik V [@doi:10.1126/science.abe3147; @url:https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/scientists-worry-whether-russias-sputnik-v-coronavirus-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective.html; @doi:10/ft7j].
Despite regulatory, safety, and efficacy concerns, pre-orders for 1 billion doses of the Sputnik V were reported within days of the vaccine's approval in Russia [@doi:10/ft7j].
Almost a month later, the phase I/II trial data was published [@doi:10/gg96hq].

In the phase I/II trial study conducted between late June and early August 2020, 76 participants (18-60 years old) were split into two groups of 38 participants, which were non-randomized in two hospitals in Russia. 
In phase I, 9 patients received rAd26 and 9 patients received rAd5-S to assess safety over 28 days. 
In phase II, at least 5 days after the completion of phase I, 20 patients received a prime-boost vaccination of rAd26-S on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 2, which was administered intramuscularly.
The phase I/II trial reported that both vaccines were deemed safe and well tolerated. 
The most common adverse events reported were mild, such as pain at the injection site (58%), hypothermia (50%), headaches (42%), fatigue (28%), and joint and muscle pain (24%). 
Seroconversion was observed in all participants three weeks post the second vaccination (day 42), and all participants produced antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. 
RBD-specific IgG levels were high in both the frozen and lyophilized versions of the vaccine (14,703 and 11,143 respectively), indicating a sufficient immune response to both.
Three weeks post the second vaccination, the virus-neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers were 49.25 and 45.95 from the frozen and lyophilized vaccines, respectively.
At 28 days, median cell proliferation of 1.3% CD4^+^ and 1.1% CD8^+^ were reported for the lyophilized vaccine and 2.5% CD4^+^ and 1.3% CD8^+^ for the vaccine stored frozen. 
These results indicated that both forms of Sputnik V appeared to be safe and induce a humoral and cellular response in human subjects [@doi:10/gg96hq], which may be robust enough to persist and not wane rapidly [@doi:10/ghx7xz]. 

A press release on November 11th, 2020 indicated positive results from an interim analysis of the phase III Sputnik V trials, which reported 92% efficacy in 16,000 volunteers [@doi:10.1126/science.abf6791].
However, this release came only two days after both Pfizer and BioNTech reported that their vaccines had an efficacy over 90%, which led to significant skepticism of the Russian findings for a myriad of reasons including the lack of a published protocol and the “reckless” approval of the vaccine in Russia months prior to the publication of the interim results of the phase III trial [@doi:10.1126/science.abf6791; @doi:10.1038/d41586-020-03209-0].
In February 2021, the interim results of the phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were eventually published in _The Lancet_ [@doi:10/ghxj4g].
The multicenter trial enrolled 21,862 participants over the age of 18 years old in Moscow, Russia. 
The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a 0.5 mL/dose of vaccine or placebo, which was comprised of the vaccine buffer composition, that was delivered intramuscularly using the same prime-boost regimen as in the phase I/II trials. 
From September 7th to Nov 24th, 19,866 participants completed the trial.
Of the 14,964 participants who received the vaccine, 16 (0.1%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, whereas 62 of the 4,902 participants (1.3%) in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19. 
Of these participants, no moderate or severe cases of COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group, juxtaposed with 20 in the placebo group.
However, only symptomatic individuals were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection in this trial. 
Therefore, asymptomatic infections were not detected, thus potentially inflating the efficacy estimate.
Overall, a vaccine efficacy of 91.6% (95% CI 85.6-95.2) was reported, where an efficacy of 91.8% was reported for those over 60 years old and 92.7% for those who were 51-60 years old. 
Indeed, 14 days after the first dose, 87.6% efficacy was achieved and the immunity required to prevent disease occurred within 18 days of vaccination. 
Based on these results, scientists are investigating the potential for a single dose regimen of the rAd26-S sputnik V vaccine [@doi:10.1136/bmj.n309].
By the end of the trial, 7,485 participants reported adverse events, of which 94% were grade I.
Of the 68 participants who experienced serious adverse events during the trial,  45 from the vaccine group and 23 from the placebo groups, none were reported to be associated with the vaccination. 
Likewise, 4 deaths occurred during the trial period that were not related to the vaccine [@doi:10/ghxj4g].
The interim findings of the phase III trial indicate that the Sputnik V vaccine regimen appears to be safe with 91.6% efficacy.
Moving forward, Gamaleya intends to reach a total of 40,000 participants for the completion of their phase III trial.  
Indeed, other trials involving Sputnik V are currently underway in Belarus, India, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela [@url:https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/].

Preliminary results of a trial of Argentinian healthcare workers in Buenos Aires who were vaccinated with the Sputnik V rAd26-R vector-based vaccine seems to support the short term safety of the first vaccination [@url:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251071]. 
Of the 707 vaccinated healthcare workers, 71.3% of the 96.6% of respondents reported at least one adverse event attributed to the vaccine. 
Of these individuals, 68% experienced joint and muscle pain, 54% had injection site pain, 11% reported redness and swelling, 40% had a fever, and 5% reported diarrhea. 
Only 5% of the vaccinated participants experienced serious adverse events that required medical attention, of which one was monitored as an inpatient.

Overall, there is hesitancy surrounding the management of the Sputnik V vaccine approval process and concerns over whether the efficacy data may be inflated due to a lack of asymptomatic testing within the trial.
However, further trials are underway, which will likely shed light on the overall efficacy and safety of the Sputnik V vaccine regimen. 
There may be some advantage to the Sputnik V approach including the favorable storage conditions afforded by choice between a frozen and lyophilized vaccine. 
Furthermore, the producers of Gam-COVID-Vac state that they can produce the vaccine at a cost of less than $10 per dose or less than $20 per patient [@url:https://sputnikvaccine.com].

#### Janssen’s Ad26.COV2-S

### Inactivated Whole Virus Vaccines

<!--Rephrase to match figure? Or rephrase figure?-->
These types of vaccines use full virus particles that have been rendered non-infectious by chemical (i.e. using formaldehyde or &beta;-propiolactone [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1357471]) or physical means (i.e. heat).
Though these virus particles are inactivated they still have the capacity to prime the immune system.
The size of the virus particle makes it ideal for uptake by antigen presenting cells (APC), which leads to stimulation of helper T-cells [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
Additionally, the array of epitopes on the surface of the virus increases antibody binding efficiency [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
The native conformation of the surface proteins, which is also important for eliciting an immune response, is preserved using these techniques.
Membrane proteins, which support B-cell response to surface proteins, are also included using this method [@doi:10.1084/jem.164.4.1114]. 
Overall, these vaccines are able to mimic the key properties of the virus that stimulate a robust immune response, but the risk of adverse reactions is reduced because the virus is inactivated, thus unable to replicate.
Some common successful whole virus vaccine include targeting influenza viruses, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus.

#### SinoVac's CoronaVac

The CoronaVac vaccine is being developed by SinoVac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company.
The vaccine is using an inactivate whole virus with the addition of an aluminum adjuvant [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.585354].
The vaccine is currently in Phase III clinical trials --> check status.

Pre-clinical trials were performed using BALB/c mice and rhesus macaques [@doi:10.1126/science.abc1932].
The SARS-CoV-2 strains used in this trial isolated from 11 hospitalized patients (5 from China, 3 from Italy, 1 from the UK, 1 from Spain).
A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the strains were representative of the current circulating variants.
One of the strains, CN2, from China was used as the inactivated and purified virus while the other 10 strains were used to challenge.
The CN2 was grownup in Vero cells.
An ELISA assay was used to assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine.
10 mice were injected with the vaccine on day 0 and day 7 with varying doses (0, 1.5, 3 or 6 &mu;g), and 10 mice were treated with physiological saline as the control.
IgG developed in the serum of all vaccinated mice.
Using the same setup to the immunogenecity was also assessed in macaques.
4 macaques were treated with 3 &mu;g at day 0, 7 and 14.
4 macaques were treated with a high does of 6 &mu;g at day 0, 7 and 14.
4 macaques received a placebo vaccine, and another 4 received only the adjuvant.
All vaccinated macaques induced IgGs and neutralizing antibodies.
After challenge with SARS-CoV-2, strain CN1, vaccinated macaques were protected compared to control macaques (placebo or adjuvant only) based on histology and viral loads collected from different regions of the lung.

Phase I/II clinical trials were conducted in adults 18-59 years old [@doi:10/fpcx] and adults over 60 years old [@doi:10/fx8z] in China.
In the case of adults 18-59 years old, a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I/II trial was conducted in April 2020.
Patients in this study were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China.
For the phase I trial, 144 (of 185 screened) participants were enrolled, with 72 enrolled in the 14-day interval cohort (i.e. treated on day 0 and day 14) and 72 in the 28-day interval cohort.  
This group of 72 participants were split into 2 blocks for low-dose (3 &mu;g) and high-dose (6 &mu;g).
Within each block, participants were randomly assigned vaccination with CoronaVac or placebo (aluminum diluent without the virus) at a 2:1 ratio.
Both the vaccine and placebo were prepared in a Good Manufacturing Practice-accredited facility of Sinovac Life Sciences (Beijing, China).

The phase II trial followed the same organization of participants, this time using 300 enrolled participants in the 14-day and another 300 enrolled in the 28-day group.
One change of note was that the vaccine was produced using a highly automated bioreactor (ReadyToProcess WAVE 25, GE, Umea, Sweden) to increase vaccine production capacity.
This change resulted in a higher intact spike protein content.
The authors of this study were not aware of this antigen-level difference between the vaccine batches for the phase I/II when the ethical approval for the trials occurred.

To assess adverse responses, participants were asked to record any events up to 7 days post-treatment. 
The reported adverse events were graded according to the China National Medical Products Administration guidelines.
In the phase 1 trial, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 29-38% of patients in the 0 to 14 day group, 13-17% in the 0 to 28 day vaccination group.
The most common symptom was pain at the injection site, which was reported by 17-21% of patients in the 0 to 14 day cohort and 13% in the 0 to 28 day cohort.
Most adverse reactions were mild (grade 1) where parients recovered within 48 hours.
There was a single case of acute hypersensitivity with manifestation of urticaria 48 hours following the first dose of study drug was reported in the 6 &mu;g group
Most adverse reactions were mild (grade 1) in severity and participants recovered within 48 h. 
There was a single case, from the 6 &mu;g group, of acute hypersensitivity with manifestation of urticaria 48 h after the first dose.
Both the 14-day and 28-day cohorts had a strong neutralizing Ab response.

In a study with older patients (older than 60 years), they performed another single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I/II trial [@doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30987-7].
The phase I trial was looking at dose escalation using 3 dosages: 1.5, 3 and 6 &mu;g.
The mean age of participants was 65.8 years (std = 4.8).
Of 95 screened participants, 72 were enrolled.
These 72 participants were split into low (3 &mu;g) and high (6 &mu;g) dose groups.
Within each groups 24 were treated and 12 were placebo.
A neutralizing antibody response against live SARS-CoV-2 was detected compared to baseline.
This response was similar across the two dose concentrations.
Additionally, they did not observe a difference in response between age groups (60–64 years, 65–69 years, and ≥70 years).

In the phase II the mean age was 66.6 years (std = 4.7).
499 participants were screened and 350 were enrolled.
300 were evenly split into 1.5, 3 and 6 &mu;g dose groups.
The remaining 50 were assigned to the placebo group.
Again, they found a neutralizing antibody response in phase II.
There wasn't a signficant different between the response using 3 &mu;g versus 6 &mu;g, but the response was higher compared to using 1.5 &mu;g.

Participants were required to record adverse reaction events within the first 7 days after each dose.
The safety results were combined across phage I and II.
All adverse reactions were either mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity.
The most common symptom was pain at the injection site (9%) and fever (3%).
2% (7 participants) reported severe adverse events (4 from the 1.5 &mu;g group, 1 from the 3 &mu;g group, 2 from the 6 &mu;g group), though these were found to be unrelated to the vaccine.


The phase III trials are currently being conducted in Brazil [@doi:10.1186/s13063-020-04775-4].
This was a randomized, multicenter, endpoint driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
They are expecting 13,060 participants with 11,800 ages 18 to 59 years and 1,260 age 60+.
Participants will be health care professionals.

### Protein Subunit Vaccines

<!--Do we need to add this to the figure? Or does it fall in one of the other categories?-->
Compared to the inactivated whole virus vaccines, these protein subunit vaccines isolate a single protein of the virus and use it to stimulate the immune system.
These proteins, also referred to as antigens, are usually those located on the surface of the viral particle and are therefore key targets of the immune system.
These proteins are typically grown in yeast and then harvested.
This vaccine can stimulate antibodies and CD4^+^ T-cell response [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-1823-5].
The main advantage of this method is that they are considered very safe because the antigen alone cannot cause an infection; however, the immune response is weaker and an adjuvant is usually needed to boost the response [@doi:10.1517/14712598.2011.573624].

### Vaccine Development Summary

### Complementary Approaches to Vaccine Development

#### Adjuvants for Vaccines

Adjuvants include a variety of molecules or larger microbial-related products that have an effect on the immune system or an immune response of interest.
They can either be comprised of or contain immunostimulants or immunomodulators.
Adjuvants are sometimes included within vaccines, especially vaccines other than live-attenuated and inactivated viruses, in order to enhance the immune response.
A review on the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [@doi:10.3390/vaccines8020153] also included a brief summary of the potential of adjuvants for these vaccines, including a brief description of some already commonly used adjuvants.
Different adjuvants can regulate different types of immune responses, so the type or combination of adjuvants used in a vaccine will depend on both the type of vaccine and concern related to efficacy and safety.
A variety of possible mechanisms for adjuvants have been researched [@doi:10.1038/nri2510; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2018.02619; @doi:10.3390/vaccines8010128], including the following: induction of DAMPs that can be recognized by certain PRRs of the innate immune system; functioning as PAMP that can also be recognized by certain PRRs; and more generally enhancing the humoral or cellular immune responses.
Selection of one or more adjuvants requires considering how to promote the advantageous effects of the components and/or immune response and, likewise, to inhibit possible deleterious effects.
There are also considerations related to the method of delivering (or co-delivering) the adjuvant and antigen components of a vaccine.

#### Trained Immunity

Another approach that is being investigated explores the potential for vaccines that are not made from the SARS-CoV-2 virus to confer what has been termed trained immunity. 
In a recent review [@doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6], trained immunity was defined as forms of memory that are temporary (e.g., months or years) and reversible. 
It is induced by exposure to whole-microorganism vaccines or other microbial stimuli that generates heterologous protective effects.
Trained immunity can be displayed by innate immune cells or innate immune features of other cells, and it is characterized by alterations to immune responsiveness to future immune challenges due to epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms.
These alterations can take the form of either an increased or decreased response to immune challenge by a pathogen.
Trained immunity elicited by non-SARS-CoV-2 whole-microorganism vaccines could potentially improve SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or severity [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042].

One type of stimulus which research indicates can induce trained immunity is bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination.
BCG is an attenuated form of bacteria _Mycobacterium bovis_.
The vaccine is most commonly administered for the prevention of tuberculosis in humans.
Clinical trials in non-SARS-CoV-2-infected adults have been designed to assess whether BCG vaccination could have prophylactic effects against SARS-CoV-2 by reducing susceptibility, preventing infection, or reducing disease severity.
A number of trials are now evaluating the effects of the BCG vaccine or the related vaccine VPM1002 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042; @clinicaltrials:NCT04327206; @clinicaltrials:NCT04328441; @clinicaltrials:NCT04348370; @clinicaltrials:NCT04350931; @clinicaltrials:NCT04362124; @clinicaltrials:NCT04369794; @clinicaltrials:NCT04373291; @clinicaltrials:NCT04379336; @clinicaltrials:NCT04384549; @clinicaltrials:NCT04387409; @clinicaltrials:NCT04414267; @clinicaltrials:NCT04417335; @clinicaltrials:NCT04435379; @clinicaltrials:NCT04439045].

The ongoing trials are using a number of different approaches.
Some trials enroll healthcare workers, other trials hospitalized elderly adults without immunosuppression who get vaccinated with placebo or BCG at hospital discharge, and yet another set of trials older adults (>50 years) under chronic care for conditions like hypertension and diabetes.
One set of trials, for example, uses time until first infection as the primary study endpoint; more generally, outcomes measured in some of these trials are related to incidence of disease and disease severity or symptoms.
Some analyses have suggested a possible correlation at the country level between the frequency of BCG vaccination (or BCG vaccination policies) and the severity of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042].
Currently it is unclear whether this correlation has any connection to trained immunity.
Many possible confounding factors are also likely to vary among countries, such as age distribution, detection efficiency, stochastic epidemic dynamic effects, differences in healthcare capacity over time in relation to epidemic dynamics, and these have not been adequately accounted for in current analyses. <!-- TO DO: add in study that debunks this-->
It is unclear whether there is an effect of the timing of BCG vaccination, both during an individual's life cycle and relative to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, given that severe SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a dysregulated immune response, it is unclear what alterations to the immune response would be most likely to be protective versus pathogenic (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009; @doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.009; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042; @doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.008]).
The article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] proposes that trained immunity might lead to an earlier and stronger response, which could in turn reduce viremia and the risk of later, detrimental immunopathology.
While trained immunity is an interesting possible avenue to complement vaccine development efforts through the use of an existing vaccine, additional research is required to assess whether the BCG vaccine is likely to confer trained immunity in the case of SARS-CoV-2.

### Discussion

Additionally, major advances in vaccines using mRNA and adenoviruses that have led to three vaccines becoming available or close to becoming available in late 2020 (Figure @fig:therapeutics). <!-- Update depending on where this goes and specify countries etc.-->

Though some concerns remain about the duration of sustained immunity for convalescents, vaccine development efforts are ongoing and show initial promising results.
<!-- TO DO: Needs to be updated with vaccine info about duration, this is changing rapidly so leaving for now-->
The Moderna trial, for example, reported that the neutralizing activity in participants who received two doses of the vaccine was similar to that observed in convalescent plasma.

One of the two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162b2, has been issued an EUA for patients as young as 16 [@url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization], while ModernaTX has begun a clinical trial to assess its mRNA vaccine in adolescents ages 12 to 18 [@url:https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-covid].
