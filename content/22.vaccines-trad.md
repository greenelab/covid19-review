## Application of Traditional Vaccine Development Strategies to SARS-CoV-2

### Abstract

Over the past 150 years, vaccines have revolutionized the relationship between people and disease.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies such as mRNA vaccines have received significant attention due to their novelty and successes.
However, more traditional vaccine development platforms have also been applied against SARS-CoV-2, yielding important tools in the worldwide fight against the virus.

A variety of approaches have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines that are now authorized for use in countries around the world.
In this review, we highlight strategies that focus on the viral capsid outwards, rather than on the nucleic acids inside.
Such approaches broadly fall into two categories: whole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines.
Whole-virus vaccine approaches use the virus itself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state.
Subunit vaccines isolate an immunogenic component of the virus using various strategies that is then introduced through vaccination.
We highlight specific vaccine candidates that utilize these approaches in different ways.
In a companion manuscript, we review the more recent and novel development of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies.

We further consider the role that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in providing immunity to people around the world.
Well-established vaccine technologies have proved especially important because of the significant role they have played in COVID-19 vaccine access at the global scale.
Vaccine development programs that use established platforms have been undertaken in a much wider range of countries than those using nucleic-acid-based technologies, which have been led by wealthy Western countries.
Therefore, these vaccine platforms, while less cutting-edge on the biotechnology side, have proven to be extremely important to the management of SARS-CoV-2.

### Importance

As of {{csse_date_pretty}}, there have been over {{csse_cases}} SARS-CoV-2 cases, and the virus has taken the lives of at least {{csse_deaths}} people globally [@doi:10/ggnsjk].
The development, production, and distribution of vaccines is imperative to saving lives, preventing illness, and reducing the economic and social burdens caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Much emphasis has been placed on vaccines that use cutting-edge biotechnology.
However, more traditional methods of vaccine development that were refined throughout the twentieth century have been critical in increasing vaccine access worldwide.
Effective deployment is necessary to reducing the susceptibility of the world's population, which is especially important in light of emerging variants.
In this review, we discuss the safety, efficacy, and distribution of vaccines developed using established technologies.
In a separate review, we describe the vaccines developed using nucleic acid-based vaccine platforms.
From the current literature, it is clear that the well-established vaccine technologies are also highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 and are being used to address the challenges of COVID-19 globally, including in low- and middle-income countries.
This worldwide approach is critical for reducing the devastating impact of SARS-CoV-2.

### Introduction

The development of vaccines is widely considered one of the most important medical advances in human history.
Over the past 150 years, several approaches to vaccination have been developed and refined [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated atypical circumstances compared to past health crises, leading to differences in vaccine development against this pathogen.
One way in which the COVID-19 pandemic differs from prior global health crises is that the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was sequenced, assembled, and released very early on (January 2020).
This genomic information has been important in shaping the biomedical response to this pathogen [@individual-pathogenesis; @individual-pharmaceuticals].
All the same, vaccines have been developed since long before the concept of a virus or a viral genome was known, and as early as September 2020, there were over 180 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in development, many of which used more traditional vaccine technologies [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].
However, media attention has largely focused on vaccine development platforms that have produced vaccine candidates using new technologies, especially mRNA vaccines due to their rapid deployment.
We review vaccine technologies used for SARS-CoV-2 in two parts: here, the application of traditional vaccine development platforms to SARS-CoV-2, and separately, nucleic acid-based approaches [@individual-vaccines-novel].

Understanding vaccine development programs that are using well-established technologies is important for a global perspective on COVID-19.
As of {{viper_date_pretty}}, {{viper_vaccine_counts}} SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been approved for use in at least one country.
A resource tracking the distribution of {{owid_vaccine_counts}} vaccines indicates that, as of {{owid_most_recent_date}}, {{owid_worldwide_total_vaccinations}} doses have been administered across {{owid_total_countries}} countries [@doi:10.1038/s41562-021-01122-8].
Many of these vaccines use platforms that do not require information about the viral genome, with {{viper_num_approved_subunit}} developed using subunit and {{viper_num_approved_whole_virus}} using whole-virus approaches.
The types of vaccines available varies widely throughout the world, as the process of developing and deploying a vaccine is complex and often requires coordination between government, industry, academia, and philanthropic entities [@doi:10.1126/science.abc5312].

Another difference between prior global health crises and the COVID-19 pandemic is the way that vaccines are evaluated.
A vaccine's success is often discussed in terms of vaccine efficacy (VE), which describes the protection conferred during clinical trials [@url:https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection].
The real-world protection offered by a vaccine is referred to as its effectiveness [@url:https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection].
Additionally, protection can mean different things in different contexts.
In general, the goal of a vaccine is to prevent disease, especially severe disease, rather than infection itself.
As a proxy for VE, vaccine developers often test their candidates for serum neutralizing activity, which has been proposed as a biomarker for adaptive immunity in other respiratory illnesses [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2022483].
The duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it possible to test multiple vaccines in phase III trials, where the effect of the vaccines on a cohort’s likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 can be evaluated, whereas this has not always been feasible for other infectious diseases.
In some cases (e.g., SARS), the pathogen has been controlled before vaccine candidates were available, while in others (e.g., MERS), the scale of the epidemic has been smaller.
Vaccine development is traditionally a slow process, but the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic created an atypical vaccine development ecosystem where fast development and production was prioritized.
Estimates of VE have been released for many vaccine candidates across a number of technology types based on phase III trial data.

However, efficacy is not a static value, and real-world efficacy can vary with location and over time.
Shifts in efficacy have been an especially heightened topic of concern since late 2021 given the potential for variants of SARS-CoV-2 to influence VE.
Due to viral evolution, vaccine developers are in an arms race with a pathogen that benefits from mutations that reduce its susceptibility to adaptive immunity.
The evolution of several variants of concern (VOC) presents significant challenges for vaccines developed based on the index strain identified in Wuhan in late 2019.
We discuss these variants in depth elsewhere [@individual-evolution].
To date, the most significant VOC identified are Alpha (2020), Beta (2020), Gamma (2020), Delta (2021), and Omicron (2021), with various subvariants of Omicron being the most recently identified (2022).
The efficacy of vaccines in the context of these variants is discussed where information is available.

While the relationship between a vaccine and a pathogen is not static, the data clearly demonstrates that a variety of efficacious vaccines have been developed against SARS-CoV-2.
Here we discuss a selection of programs that use well-established vaccine biotechnologies.
These programs have been undertaken worldwide, in complement to the more cutting-edge approaches developed and distributed in the United States (U.S.), the European Union (E.U.), the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Russia [@individual-vaccines-novel].
In this review, we discuss vaccine development using two well-established technologies, whole-virus vaccination and subunit vaccination, and the role these technologies have played in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Whole-Virus Vaccines

Whole-virus vaccines have the longest history among vaccine development approaches.
Variolation, which is widely considered the first vaccination strategy in human history, is one example [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2].
Famously, variolation was employed against smallpox when healthy individuals were exposed to pus from an individual infected with what was believed to be either cowpox or horsepox [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2; @doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.003].
This approach worked by inducing a mild case of a disease.
Therefore, while whole-virus vaccines confer adaptive immunity, they also raise safety concerns [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611].
As of 2005, most vaccines still used whole-virus platforms [@doi:10/dn299p], and these technologies remain valuable tools in vaccine development today [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Whole virus vaccine candidates have been developed for COVID-19 using both live attenuated viruses and inactivated whole viruses.

#### Live-Attenuated Virus Vaccines

Live-attenuated virus vaccines (LAV), also known as replication-competent vaccines, use a weakened, living version of a disease-causing virus or a version of a virus that is modified to induce an immune response [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].
Whether variolation is the first example of a LAV being used to induce immunity is debated [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
The first deliberate (albeit pathogen-naïve) attempt to develop an attenuated viral vaccine dates back to Louis Pasteur's efforts in 1885 to inoculate a child against rabies.
The next intentional LAVs were developed against the yellow fever virus in 1935 and influenza in 1936 [@doi:10.1128/9781555818951].

Early efforts in LAV development relied on either the identification of a related virus that was less virulent in humans (e.g., cowpox/horsepox or rotavirus vaccines) or the culturing of a virus _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Today, a virus can be attenuated by passaging it in a foreign host until, due to selection pressure, the virus loses its efficacy in the original host.
Alternatively, selective gene deletion or codon deoptimization can be utilized to attenuate the virus [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3], or foreign antigens can be integrated into an attenuated viral vector [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].
LAVs tend to be restricted to viral replication in the tissues around the location of inoculation [@doi:10.1128/9781555818951], and some can be administered intranasally [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].

Today, LAVs are used globally to prevent diseases caused by viruses such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio, influenza, varicella zoster, and the yellow fever virus [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-35761-6.00002-X].
There were attempts to develop LAVs against both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256], but no vaccines were approved.
It is generally recognized that LAVs induce an immune response similar to natural infection, and they are favored because they induce long-lasting and robust immunity that can protect from disease.
This strong protective effect is induced in part by the immune response to the range of viral antigens available from LAV, which tend to be more immunogenic than those from non-replicating vaccines [@url:https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032].

#### Application to COVID-19

To date, LAVs have not been widely deployed against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
All the same, there are several COVID-19 LAV candidates in the early (preclinical/phase I) stages of investigation.
These candidates utilize different approaches.

One candidate in the preclinical stage is YF-S0, a single-dose LAV developed at Belgium's Katholieke Universiteit Leuven that uses live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) as a vector for a noncleavable prefusion conformation of the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].
YF-S0 induced a robust immune response in three animal models and prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques and hamsters [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].

Other programs are developing codon deoptimized LAV candidates [@url:https://news.griffith.edu.au/2020/04/23/griffith-university-researchers-on-the-road-to-covid-19-vaccine; @url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org; @doi:10.1073/pnas.2102775118].
This approach follows the synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) strategy to select codon substitutions that are suboptimal for the virus [@doi:10.1126/science.1155761; @doi:10.1073/pnas.2102775118].
New York-based Codagenix and the Serum Institute of India reported a successful preclinical investigation [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2102775118] of an intranasally administered deoptimized SARS-CoV-2 LAV known as COVI-VAC, and COVI-VAC entered phase I human trials and dosed its first participants in January 2021 [@url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org; @clinicaltrials:NCT04619628].
This vaccine is optimized through the removal of the furin cleavage site (see [@individual-pathogenesis] for a discussion of this site's importance) and deoptimization of 283 codons [@pmc:PMC8644885].
The results of the COVI-VAC phase I human trials are expected soon.

Another company, Meissa Vaccines in Kansas, U.S., which also develops vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), has developed an intranasal live-attenuated chimeric vaccine.
Chimeric vaccines integrate genomic content from multiple viruses to create a more stable LAV [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2019.02881].
Enrollment for phase I human trials began in March 2021 and recruitment is ongoing [@url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org; @clinicaltrials:NCT04798001].

Finally, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines that use LAVs are being investigated for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 (see online Appendix [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/covid19-review]).
The purpose of the BCG vaccine is to prevent tuberculosis, but non-specific effects against other respiratory illnesses have suggested a possible benefit against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0337-y].
However, a multicenter trial that randomly assigned participants 60 years and older to vaccination with BCG (n = 1,008) or placebo (n = 1,006) found that BCG vaccination had no effect on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory infections over the course of 12 months [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciac182].
Despite these findings, BCG vaccination was associated with a stronger cytokine (IL-6) response following _ex vivo_ stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with no known history of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciac182].
Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals who had received the BCG vaccine one year prior showed increased immunoglobulin (Ig) responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) relative to individuals who had received a placebo vaccine [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciac182].
Currently, investigations of BCG vaccines against COVID-19 are being sponsored by institutes in Australia in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [@clinicaltrials:NCT04327206] and by Texas A&M University in collaboration with numerous other U.S. institutions [@clinicaltrials:NCT04348370].

Safety data is not yet available for human studies of LAV COVID-19 vaccines.
In general, though, safety concerns previously associated with LAV have been largely mitigated in the modern manufacturing process.
Manufacturers use safe and reliable methods to produce large quantities of vaccines once they have undergone rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy.
However, one remaining safety concern may be contributing to the relatively slow emergence of LAV candidates against COVID-19: they still may present risk to individuals who are immunocompromised [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2007.10.010], which is an even greater concern when dealing with a novel virus and disease.
Additional data are needed to ascertain how this technology performs in the case of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the long and trusted history of LAV development, this vaccine strategy has not been favored against COVID-19, as other technologies have shown greater expediency and safety compared to the time-consuming nature of developing LAVs for a novel virus.

#### Response to Variants of Concern

While no phase III trial data is available for LAV vaccine candidates, some manufacturers have proactively sought to respond to the emergence of VOC.
For example, a poster reported that Syrian golden hamsters who received COVI-VAC were significantly less likely to lose weight following viral challenge with the Beta VOC [@pmc:PMC8644885].
Additionally, the protective effect of YF-S0 against VOC has been investigated in hamsters [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
Even for a small number of hamsters that developed breakthrough infections after exposure to the index strain or the Alpha variant, viral loads were very low [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
However, much higher rates of breakthrough infection and higher viral loads were observed when the hamsters were exposed to the Beta variant [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
Reduced seroconversion and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were also observed against the Beta and Gamma variants [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
As a result, a modified version of YF-S0, called YF-S0\*, was developed to include a modified spike protein intended to increase immunogenicity by including the full spectrum of amino acids found in the Gamma VOC as well as stabilizing the S protein's conformation [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
The updated vaccine was again tested in Syrian golden hamsters.
No breakthrough infections were observed following vaccination with YF-S0\* and exposure to the index strain and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
YF-S0\* also reduced the infectious viral load in the lungs of several VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) relative to a sham comparison [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374], and the likelihood of the Delta variant spreading to unvaccinated co-housed hamsters was significantly reduced by YF-S0\* [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
The updated vaccine was also associated with the increased production of nAbs against the Omicron variant compared to YF-S0 [@doi:10.1101/2021.11.12.468374].
Therefore, while data from human studies are not available, preclinical results suggest that LAV vaccines likely confer some protection against VOC even when designed with the index strain.
Modifications to the design may make this protection more robust as SARS-CoV-2 evolves.

### Inactivated Whole-Virus Vaccines

Inactivated whole-virus (IWV) vaccines are another well-established vaccine platform.
This platform uses full virus particles generally produced via cell culture that have been rendered non-infectious by chemical (i.e., formaldehyde or &beta;-propiolactone [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1357471]) or physical (i.e., heat or ultraviolet radiation) means.
In general, these vaccines mimic the key properties of the virus that stimulate a robust immune response, but the risk of adverse reactions is reduced because the virus is inactivated and thus unable to replicate.
Though these viral particles are inactivated, they retain the capacity to prime the immune system.
The size of the viral particle makes it ideal for uptake by antigen-presenting cells, which leads to the stimulation of helper T-cells [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
Additionally, the array of epitopes on the surface of the virus increases antibody binding efficiency [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
The native conformation of the surface proteins, which is also important for eliciting an immune response, is preserved using these techniques [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.03.025].
Membrane proteins, which support B-cell responses to surface proteins, are also induced by this method [@doi:10.1084/jem.164.4.1114].

IWV vaccines have been a valuable tool in efforts to control many viruses.
Some targets of IWV vaccines have included influenza viruses, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus.
Inactivated vaccines can generally be generated relatively quickly once the pathogenic virus has been isolated and can be passaged in cell culture [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256; @doi:10.1111/1751-7915.13818].
During COVID-19, though the World Health Organization (WHO) has been slower to approve IWV vaccine candidates than those developed with nucleic acid-based technologies, IWV vaccine development was also fast.
In China, the first emergency use authorization (EUA) was granted to an IWV vaccine in July 2020, with full approval following that December [@url:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/china-gives-its-first-covid-19-vaccine-approval-sinopharm-2020-12-31; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/china-vaccine-coronavirus.html].  
The fact that these vaccines have not received as much public attention (at least in Western media) as nucleic acid vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 may be due at least in part to the novelty of nucleic acid vaccine technologies [@doi:10.1038/d41586-020-03626-1], which are more modular and immunogenic [@individual-vaccines-novel].

Past applications to human coronaviruses (HCoV) have focused predominantly on SARS-CoV-1.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IWV SARS-CoV-1 vaccine candidates elicited immune responses _in vivo_.
These vaccines generated nAb titers at concentrations similar to those evoked by recombinant protein vaccines [@doi:10.1002/rmv.492; @doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.03.025].
Studies in ferrets and non-human primates demonstrated that IWV vaccines can offer protection against infection due to nAb and SARS-CoV-1-specific T cell responses [@doi:10.1093/intimm/dxh143].
However, several attempts to develop IWV vaccines against both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were hindered by incidences of vaccine-associated disease enhancement (VADE) in preclinical studies [@doi:10.1038/s41579-020-00462-y].
In one example of a study in macaques, an inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccine induced even more severe lung damage than the virus due to an enhanced immune reaction [@doi:10.1021/acsinfecdis.6b00006].
Independent studies in mice also demonstrated evidence of lung immunopathology due to VADE in response to MERS-CoV IWV vaccination [@doi:10.1080/21645515.2016.1177688; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00554-20].
The exact mechanisms responsible for VADE remain elusive due to the specificity of the virus-host interactions involved, but VADE is the subject of investigation in preclinical SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies to ensure the safety of any potential vaccines that may reach phase I trials and beyond [@doi:10.1038/s41579-020-00462-y].

One of those, CoronaVac, was developed by Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac.
The developers inactivated a SARS-CoV-2 strain collected in China with &beta;-propiolactone and propagated it using Vero cells [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256].
The vaccine is coupled with an aluminum adjuvant to increase immunogenicity [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256].
In phase I and II clinical trials, CoronaVac elicited a strong immunogenic response in animal models and the development of nAbs in human participants [@doi:10/fx8z; @doi:10.1126/science.abc1932; @doi:10/fpcx].
Administration followed a prime-boost regimen using a 0.5 ml dose containing 3 &mu;g of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus per dose [@url:https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-Sinovac-CoronaVac-background-2021.1].

Results from a two-dose phase III trial following a 14-day prime boost became available in late 2020 [@doi:10/gk898z], and an interim analysis identified specific IgG nAbs against the S1 RBD and a robust IFN-&gamma; secreting T cell response was induced via immunization with CoronaVac [@doi:10.1101/2021.03.31.21254494].
Safety analysis of the CoronaVac vaccine during the phase II trial revealed that most adverse reactions were either mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity.
In adults aged 18 to 59 years receiving a variety of dosage schedules, site injection pain was consistently the most common symptom reported [@doi:10/fpcx].
In older adults, the most common local and systemic reactions were pain at the injection site (9%) and fever (3%), respectively [@doi:10/fx8z].
In phase III trials, minimal side effects were reported [@doi:10/gk898z].

Estimates of CoronaVac's VE have varied across trials.
CoronaVac demonstrated an efficacy of a little over 50% in Brazil, which was contested by Turkish officials claiming an efficacy of 91.25%, but ultimately after multiple announcements, the efficacy debate was settled at over 50% [@url:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sinovac-brazil/brazil-institute-says-coronavac-efficacy-above-50-but-delays-full-results-idUSKBN28X2CR; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/health/turkey-brazil-sinovac-coronavirus-vaccine.html].
Subsequently, an interim analysis of the phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted in Turkey enrolling 10,214 participants (approximately 2:1 vaccine:placebo) indicated efficacy of 83.5%, with minimal side effects reported [@doi:10/gk898z], and a prospective national cohort study in Chile reported an adjusted estimated effectiveness of 66% for the prevention of COVID-19 with an estimated 90% and 87% prevention of hospitalization and death, respectively [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107715].

CoronaVac was first approved in China and has now been distributed in {{Sinovac_country_count}} countries across {{Sinovac_continents}}, including Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uruguay [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html; @doi:10.1038/s41562-021-01122-8].
As of August 2021, Sinovac had reportedly produced over a billion doses of CoronaVac [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].

Two additional inactivated vaccine candidates were developed following a similar approach by the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., more commonly known as Sinopharm CNBG.
One, known as BBIBP-CorV or Covilo, was developed in Beijing using the HB02 variant of SARS-CoV-2.
At Sinopharm CNBG's Wuhan Institute, a second vaccine was developed using the WIV04 variant of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1038/s41541-021-00292-w].
The viruses were purified, propagated using Vero cells, isolated, and inactivated using β-propiolactone [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008; @doi:10.1038/s41541-021-00292-w].
Both vaccines are adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008; @doi:10.1038/s41541-021-00292-w].

Preclinical studies indicated that Covilo induced sufficient nAb titers in mice, and a prime-boost immunization scheme of 2 &mu;g/dose was sufficient to protect rhesus macaques from disease [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008].
For the other vaccine, nAbs were detected in all groups 14 days after the final dose in the phase I part of the trial [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.15543], with similar findings reported in interim phase II data [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.15543].
In phase II trials, the BBIBP-CorV vaccine appeared well-tolerated, with 23% of participants in the vaccine condition (482 total participants, 3:1, vaccine:placebo) reporting at least one adverse reaction characterized as mild to moderate [@doi:10/ghjkrf].
In phase III trials, Sinopharm CNBG's Covilo vaccine made from the WIV04 strain achieved an efficacy of 72.8% and was well tolerated [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.8565].
Sinopharm affiliates in the UAE in early December 2020 claimed the vaccine had 86% efficacy, which was later at odds with a Sinopharm Beijing affiliate that stated that Covilo had a 79.34% efficacy later that same month [@url:https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-china-vaccine-int-idUSKBN2940CA].

Other vaccine development programs have been led through industry partnerships with governmental organizations.
Bharat Biotech International Ltd., which is the biggest producer of vaccines globally, collaborated with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) National Institute of Virology (NIV) to develop another IWV, Covaxin, which is also known as BBV152.
Preclinical studies of Covaxin in hamsters [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-76768/v1] and macaques [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-21639-w] indicated that the vaccine induced protective responses deemed sufficient to move forward to human trials.
Phase I (July 2020) and phase I/II (September to October 2020) studies indicated that Covaxin adjuvanted with alum and a Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist was safe and immunogenic [@doi:10/gkrthh; @doi:10/gh7597].
These two studies demonstrated that the vaccine induced significant humoral and cell-mediated responses, as assessed by measuring binding [@doi:10/gkrthh] and neutralising [@doi:10/gkrthh; @doi:10/gh7597] antibodies, cytokines [@doi:10/gkrthh; @doi:10/gh7597], CD3^+, CD4^+, and CD8^+ T-cells [@doi:10/gkrthh], with some formulations also eliciting Th1-skewed memory T-cell responses [@doi:10/gh7597].
Only mild to moderate side-effects were reported upon immunization [@doi:10/gkrthh; @doi:10/gh7597].
In July 2021, Covaxin’s overall vaccine efficacy was estimated at 77.8% for the prevention of COVID-19 based on a final enrollment of 25,798 people (approximately 1:1 vaccine:placebo) [@doi:10/gmns9m].
Only mild to moderate side-effects reported upon immunization [@doi:10/gkrthh; @doi:10/gh7597], and in phase II trials, the BBIBP-CorV vaccine appeared well-tolerated, with 23% of participants in the vaccine condition (482 total participants, 3:1, vaccine:placebo) reporting at least one adverse reaction characterized as mild to moderate [@doi:10/ghjkrf].
As of September 2021, Covaxin has been approved for emergency use in {{Covaxin_country_count}} countries across {{Covaxin_continents}}, including Guyana, India, Iran, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Paraguay, and the Philippines [@url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/9].

Although IWV vaccine candidates were well-tolerated overall, both Sinovac's CoronaVac and Sinopharm's inactivated WIV04 vaccine trials were affected by concerns about adverse events.
In CoronaVac’s trial of adults 18-59, 2% (n=7) of participants reported severe adverse events [@doi:10/fx8z], causing the trial to be halted for investigation [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/sinovac-covid-19-vaccine.html].
They were determined to be unrelated to the vaccine [@doi:10/fx8z; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/sinovac-covid-19-vaccine.html], which is now widely distributed.
Similarly, a trial of the Sinopharm WIV04 vaccine in Peru was briefly paused due to safety concerns in relation to neurological symptoms [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/16/world/covid-19-coronavirus], but this was later deemed unrelated to the vaccine, and the trial continued [@clinicaltrials:NCT04612972].

#### Real-World Safety and Efficacy

In the past, problems that arose during the manufacturing of IWV vaccines could present safety issues, but oversight of the manufacturing process has helped to improve IWV vaccine safety [@doi:10.1163/25895893-bja10009].
Nevertheless, the departure from norms necessitated by the COVID-19 crisis raised concerns about whether oversight would occur at pre-pandemic standards [@doi:10.1163/25895893-bja10009].
In general, the IWV COVID-19 vaccines have reported very few issues with safety.
Additionally, safety audits have proactively identified concerns.
For example, in April 2022, the WHO suspended procurement of Covaxin from Bharat Pharmaceuticals due to concerns about deviation from good manufacturing practice in their production facilities [@url:https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/suspension-supply-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin].
However, no safety issues had been reported in association with this vaccine.
Rare cases of VADE have been reported in association with CoronaVac [@doi:10.1155/2021/9673453].

More concern has arisen around the issue of efficacy.
A major consideration in vaccine development is that vaccines lose efficacy as mutations accumulate in the epitopes of the circulating virus; IWV vaccines may be particularly affected by viral evolution [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
This loss of specificity over time is likely to be influenced by the evolution of the virus, and specifically by the rate of evolution in the region of the genome that codes for the antigenic spike protein.
The Beta variant appears to be more resistant to nAbs in sera from individuals immunized with Sinovac than the Alpha variant or wildtype virus, indicating that emerging variants may be of concern [@doi:10.1056/nejmc2103022].
In agreement with previous studies demonstrating sera from individuals vaccinated with Covaxin efficiently neutralized the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.30.454511; @doi:10.1093/jtm/taab104; @doi:10.1093/jtm/taab051], the phase III trial reported a 65.2% efficacy against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) [@doi:10/gnkdnx].
Another study reported that sera from individuals immunized with Covaxin produced effective nAbs against the Delta variant and the so-called Delta plus variant (AY.1) [@doi:10.1093/jtm/taab154].
Indeed, sera obtained from Covaxin boosted individuals (n=13) [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.24.22269189] and those who were vaccinated with Covaxin but recovered from a breakthrough infection (n=31) also neutralized the Omicron variant [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2022.03.016].

Notably, a preprint reported that antisera (i.e., the antibody-containing component of the sera) from 12 people immunized with BBIBP-CorV exhibited nAb capacity against the Beta variant (B.1.351), wild type SARS-CoV-2 (NB02), and one of the original variants of SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.01.429069].
Another preprint including sera from 282 participants used a surrogate neutralizing assay, a test that generally correlates with nAbs, to determine that Covilo appears to induce nAbs against the binding of the RBD of wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants to ACE2 [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.15.21260621].
Indeed, a study showed that the Alpha variant exhibited very little resistance to neutralization by sera of those immunized with Covilo, but the Beta variant was more resistant to neutralization by almost a factor of 3 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2103022].
The authors noted that no evidence of VADE was detected using this vaccine in phase II data [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.15543].

Concern was raised about the efficacy of CoronaVac following reports that over 350 doctors became ill with COVID-19 in Indonesia despite being immunized with CoronaVac [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/business/economy/china-vaccines-covid-outbreak.html].
In addition to concerns raised by the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to consider the duration of immunity over time.
Studies are underway to determine whether a booster immunization is required for several IWV vaccines, including CoronaVac [@clinicaltrials:NCT04962308] and Covaxin [@url:https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-booster-dose-what-is-it-what-does-govt-say-about-this-101625644184446.html].
A phase I/II clinical trial of CoronaVac in an elderly cohort (adults 60 years and older) in China determined that by 6 to 8 months following the second dose, nAb titers were detected below the seropositive cutoff [@doi:10.1101/2021.08.03.21261544].
One preprint has reported that 6 months after the second vaccination, a booster dose of CoronaVac markedly increased geometric mean titers of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.23.21261026].
However, the reduction of nAbs was ameliorated by a booster dose administered 8 months after the second CoronaVac dose.
A preprint study of healthcare workers in China has since indicated that a booster shot of Covilo elevates B cell and T cell responses and increases nAb titers [@doi:10.1101/2021.09.12.21263373].
In May 2021, the UAE announced it would consider booster shots for all citizens who had been immunized with Covilo, which was shortly followed by a similar announcement in Bahrain, and by August 29, 2021, the UAE mandated booster shots for all residents who had received Covilo [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].

Additionally, heterologous vaccine boosters are also being considered in many cases.
Indeed, Chinese [@url:https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-08-china-mixed-vaccine-trial-delta.html] and Chilean [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04992182] researchers have opted to investigate options to administer different vaccines (e.g., an mRNA vaccine dose) as a booster dose to individuals who have already received two doses of the IWV vaccine CoronaVac.
Another study determined that using a viral-vectored vaccine (CanSino's Convidecia) or an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2) instead of CoronaVac in a prime-boost vaccination regimen could induce a more robust immune response [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01677-z; @doi:10.1038/s41591-022-01705-6].
Today, the WHO has developed recommendations for booster immunization for several whole-virus vaccines.
In some cases (Valneva-VLA2001 [@1BhKEx9uG], Covaxin [@url:https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-bharat-biotech-bbv152-covaxin-vaccine-against-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know], Covilo [@url:https://www.covid19infovaccines.com/en-posts/is-the-sinopharm-bibp-covilo-covid-19-vaccine-safe-and-effective], Sinopharm-WIBP Inactivated (Vero Cell) [@sinopharm-vaccine-explainer]), boosters are recommended only for high-risk and/or high-priority groups (e.g., the immunocompromised and medical professionals, respectively), while for Sinovac-CoronaVac [@url:https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know], they are recommended more broadly.
Studies are also investigating the effects of booster doses in other vaccines [@doi:10.3390/v14092016; @clinicaltrials:NCT05172193; @clinicaltrials:NCT04510207], though some are being investigated or deployed primarily as heterologous boosters in populations vaccinated with a different primary series [@doi:10.1080/21645515.2022.2122503; @doi:10.3390/vaccines10111800 @clinicaltrials:NCT05172193].
As new vaccines are approved by the WHO, more time elapses since many received the primary series, and new variants emerge, booster recommendations are likely to increase.

### Subunit Vaccines

Efforts to overcome the limitations of live-virus vaccines led to the development of approaches first to inactivate viruses (circa 1900), leading to IWV vaccines, and then to purifying proteins from viruses cultured in eggs (circa 1920) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1402981111].
The purification of proteins then set the stage for the development of subunit vaccines based on the principle that the immune system can be stimulated by introducing one or more proteins or peptides isolated from the virus.
Today, such approaches often use antigens isolated from the surface of the viral particle that are key targets of the immune system (protein subunit vaccines).
Advances in biological engineering have also facilitated the development of approaches like viral-like particle (VLP) vaccines using nanotechnology [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-1417-3_9].
VLPs share the conformation of a virus's capsid, thereby acting as an antigen, but lack the replication machinery [@doi:10/dg35hw].
Both protein subunit and VLP vaccines thus mimic the principle of whole virus vaccines but lack the genetic material required for replication, removing the risk of infection [@doi:10.1186/s12951-021-00806-7].

Unlike whole-virus vaccines, which introduce the whole virus, subunit vaccines stimulate the immune system by introducing one or more proteins or peptides of the virus that have been isolated.
The main advantage of this platform is that subunit vaccines are considered very safe, as the antigen alone cannot cause an infection [@doi:10.1016/j.addr.2021.01.001].
Both protein subunit and VLP vaccines thus mimic the principle of whole virus vaccines but lack the genetic material required for replication, removing the risk of infection [@doi:10.1186/s12951-021-00806-7].
Protein subunit vaccines can stimulate antibodies and CD4^+^ T-cell responses [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-1823-5; @doi:10/dg35hw].

The subunit approach is also favored for its consistency in production.
The components can be designed for a highly targeted immune response to a specific pathogen using synthetic immunogenic particles, allowing the vaccine to be engineered to avoid allergen and reactogenic sequences [@doi:10.3390/vaccines2030515].
One limitation is that, in the case of protein subunit vaccines, adjuvants are usually required to boost the immune response [@doi:10.1517/14712598.2011.573624] (see online Appendix [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/covid19-review]).
Adjuvants, which are compounds that elicit an immunogenic effect, include alum (aluminum hydroxide), squalene- or saponin-based adjuvants, and Freund’s incomplete/complete adjuvants, although the latter is avoided in human and veterinary medicine due to high toxicity [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.055; @doi:10.3390/vaccines2030515; @doi:10.1093/ilar.46.3.280].

Table: Subunit vaccines approved for use in at least one country [@url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/types-of-vaccines] as of {{viper_date_pretty}}.
{#tbl:approved-subunit}

{{viper_approved_subunit}}

Protein subunit vaccine development efforts for both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV usually focused on the immunogenic RBD of the S protein [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.06.084; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.031; @doi:10.1089/vim.2009.0090].
The search for a potential SARS-CoV-1 vaccine included the development of vaccines targeting the full-length or trimeric S protein [@doi:10.1128/JVI.00083-06; @doi:10.1089/vim.2012.0076], those focused on the RBD protein only [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.031; @doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.003; @doi:10.1089/vim.2009.0090; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.06.084] or non-RBD S protein fragments [@doi:10.1089/vim.2012.0076; @doi:10.1089/dna.2005.24.510], and those targeting the N and M proteins [@doi:10.1128/jcm.43.8.3718-3726.2005; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.073; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.01.058].
These efforts have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298].
There have been examples of successful preclinical research including candidate RBD219N-1, a 218-amino-acid residue of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD that, when adjuvanted to aluminum hydroxide, was capable of eliciting a high antibody response of both nAbs and RBD-specific mAbs in both pseudovirus and live virus infections of immunized mice [@doi:10.4161/hv.27464].

Similarly to the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine candidates, the MERS-CoV protein subunit vaccine candidates generally target the RBD [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.10.031; @doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.031; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112602; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.065; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2016.10.005], with some targeting the full length S protein [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1707304114], non-RBD protein fragments such as the SP3 peptide [@doi:10.1089/vim.2014.0080], and the recombinant N-terminal domain (rNTD) [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.11.064].
Other strategies investigating the potential use of the full length S DNA have also been investigated in mice and rhesus macaques, which elicited immune responses [@doi:10.1038/ncomms8712], but these responses were not as effective as the combination of S DNA and the S1 subunit protein together [@doi:10.1038/ncomms8712; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.015].
No protein subunit vaccine for MERS-CoV has progressed beyond preclinical research to date.
VLPs have been investigated for development of vaccines against MERS and SARS [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.003; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.04.016] including testing in animal models [@doi:10.18632/oncotarget.8475; @doi:10.1007/s12250-018-0064-8], but once again, only preclinical data against HCoV has been collected [@doi:10.1186/s12929-020-00695-2].
However, protein subunit vaccines do play a role in public health and have contributed to vaccination against hepatitis B [@doi:10/d4g86c] and pertussis [@doi:10.1128/mBio.01339-14; @doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003418] since the 1980s and human papillomavirus since 2006 [@doi:10.1188/06.CJON.559-560].
They are likely to continue to contribute to public health for the foreseeable future due to ongoing research in vaccines against influenza, SARS-CoV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, dengue virus, and human papillomavirus among others [@doi:10.1016/j.micinf.2014.12.006; @url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines; @doi:10.1080/21655979.2016.1191707].

#### Application to COVID-19

The development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a remarkable achievement given the short period of time since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, particularly considering these types of vaccines have not played a major role in previous pandemics compared to LAV and IWV vaccines.
More than 20 protein subunit vaccines from companies such as Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline, Nanogen, and the Serum Institute of India have entered clinical trials for COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic [@url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines], {{viper_num_approved_subunit}} have been approved, and at least {{owid_protein_subunit_count}} are being administered worldwide [@doi:10.1038/s41562-021-01122-8; @url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org].
As of {{owid_most_recent_date}}, protein subunit vaccines are being distributed in at least {{owid_protein_subunit_countries}} countries (Figure @fig:ps-distrib).

VLP vaccines have not progressed as rapidly.
Programs seeking to develop VLP vaccines have used either the full-length S protein or the RBD of the S protein specifically as an antigen, although some use several different SARS-CoV-2 proteins [@doi:10.1016/j.addr.2021.01.001].

#### Nuvaxovid

One protein subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is NVX-CoV2373 or Nuvaxovid, produced by U.S. company Novavax and partners.
NVX-CoV2373 is a protein nanoparticle vaccine constructed from a mutated prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in combination with a specialized saponin-based adjuvant to elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.
The spike protein is recombinantly expressed in Sf9 insect cells [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8], which have previously been used for several other FDA-approved protein therapeutics [@doi:10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00985], and contains mutations in the furin cleavage site (682-RRAR-685 to 682-QQAQ-685) along with two proline substitutions (K986P and V987P) that stabilize the protein [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.660198], including improving thermostability [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8].

In preclinical mouse models, Novavax-CoV2373 elicited high anti-spike IgG titers 21 to 28 days post-vaccination that could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and protect the animals against viral challenge, with particularly strong effects when administered with the proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M^TM^ [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8].
In a phase I/II trial, a two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 was found to induce anti-spike IgG levels and nAb titers exceeding those observed in convalescent plasma donated by symptomatic patients [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2026920].
In line with the preclinical studies, the use of Matrix-M adjuvant further increased anti-spike immunoglobulin levels and induced a Th1 response.

In a phase III randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the U.K., 14,039 participants received two 5-&mu;g doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart in a 1:1 ratio from late September to late November 2020 [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2107659].
In the phase III trial, the efficacy of Novavax's Nuvaxovid was reported to be 89.7%, with a total of 10 patients developing COVID-19 in the vaccine group versus 96 in the placebo group [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107659].
No hospitalizations or deaths were reported in the vaccine group.
An additional phase III randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the U.S. and Mexico, enrolling 29,949 participants and administering at least 1 vaccine in a 2:1 ratio from late December 2020 to late February 2021 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2116185].
This trial [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2116185] used the same primary endpoints as the initial phase III trial conducted in the U.K. [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2107659].
A vaccine efficacy of 90.4% was reported based on 77 cases total, 63 of which occurred in the placebo group.
All moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group.
Hospitalization and death were not evaluated as individual secondary endpoints, but were instead included in the definition of severe COVID-19; all-cause mortality was comparable between the placebo and treatment conditions [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2116185].

The conclusions of both trials indicate that the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine is safe and effective against COVID-19.
In both trials, the vaccine was found to be well-tolerated [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264567; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107659].
The Novavax vaccine has since been authorized for use in several places, including the United Kingdom [@url:https://www.gov.uk/government/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-nuvaxovid-approved-by-mhra], the E.U. [@ema-nuvaxovid], and the U.S. [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-adjuvanted].

#### Covifenz

The leading example of a VLP approach applied to COVID-19 comes from Covifenz, developed by Canadian company Medicago [@doi:10.1503/cmaj.1095992].
This vaccine was developed using plant-based VLP technology [@url:https://medicago.com/en/our-products/our-vaccines/covifenz-covid-19-vlp-vaccine] that the company had been investigating in order to develop a high-throughput quadrivalent VLP platform to provide protection against influenza [@doi:10/gjn28x].
The approach utilizes _Nicotiana benthamiana_, an Australian relative of the tobacco plant, as an upstream bioreactor [@doi:10/gjn28x; @doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1].
Specifically, the _S_ gene from SARS-CoV-2 in its prefusion conformation is inserted into a bacterial vector (_Agrobacterium tumefaciens_) that then infects the plant cells [@doi:10/gjn28x; @doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1].
Expression of the S glycoprotein causes the production of VLPs composed of S trimers anchored in a lipid envelope that accumulate between the plasma membrane and the cell wall of the plant cell [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1].
Because these VLPs do not contain the SARS-CoV-2 genome, they offer similar advantages to whole-virus vaccines while mitigating the risks [@doi:10/gjn28x; @doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1].

In the phase I study, 180 Canadian adults ages 18 to 55 years old were administered Covifenz as two doses, 21 days apart, with three different dosages evaluated [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1].
This study reported that when the VLPs were administered with AS03, an oil-in-water emulsion containing &alpha;-tocopherol and squalene [@doi:10.1586/erv.11.192], as an adjuvant, the vaccine elicited an nAb response that was significantly (approximately 10 times) higher than that in convalescent sera [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1].
The phase III trial examined 24,141 adults assigned to the treatment and control conditions at a 1:1 ratio between March and September of 2021 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2201300].

Covifenz was reported to be 71% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the per-protocol analysis [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2201300].
Efficacy was only slightly lower in the intention-to-treat group at 69%, with the VE for the prevention of moderate-to-severe disease in this group estimated at 78.8%.
Over 24,000 participants were included in the safety analysis, which reported that 92.3% of vaccine recipients reported local adverse events compared to 45.5% of placebo recipients, with rates for systemic adverse events at 87.3% and 65.0%, respectively.
The adverse effects reported were generally mild to moderate, with the most common adverse effects being injection site pain, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and general discomfort.
Only three patients (two in the vaccine group) reported grade 4 events, all after the second dose.
The vaccine was approved for use in adults ages 18 to 65 by Health Canada in February 2022 [@url:https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/medicago-and-gsk-announce-the-approval-by-health-canada-of-covifenz].

Plant-based expression systems such as this are relatively new [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01370-1] but are likely to offer unparalleled feasibility at scale given the speed and low-cost associated with the platform [@doi:10.1111/j.1467-7652.2008.00384.x].
Additionally, the Covifenz vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8&#176;C.
However, the worldwide footprint of Covifenz, and of VLP-based technologies against SARS-CoV-2 broadly, remains small, with only {{owid_VLP_count}} VLP vaccine approved for distribution in {{owid_VLP_countries}} countries (Figure @fig:vlp-distrib).
Approval and administration of Covifenz in countries outside of Canada has been limited by concerns at the WHO about ties between Medicago and the tobacco industry [@doi:10.1503/cmaj.1095992; @doi:10.1136/bmj.o811].
While other species of plants have been explored as the upstream bioreactors for plant-derived VLPs, the specific species of tobacco used increased yield dramatically [@doi:10.4161/hv.22218].

#### Real-World Safety and Efficacy

To date, data about the effect of viral evolution on the efficacy of subunit vaccines has been limited.
_Post hoc_ analysis in the phase III trial determined that the NovaVax vaccine had an efficacy of 86.3% against the Alpha variant (identified based on the presence of the 69–70del polymorphism) and 96.4% against variants lacking the 69-70del polymorphism [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2107659].
In the second phase III trial [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264567], whole-genome sequencing was obtained from 61 of the 77 cases, and 79% of infections were identified as a VOC or variant of interest (VOI) that had been characterized at the time of the study.
Vaccine efficacy against cases caused by VOC, among which the Alpha variant was predominant (88.6%), was reported to be 92.6% [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264567].
In late 2020, an analysis of efficacy in South African adults revealed an overall efficacy of 60.1% and a slightly lower efficacy of 50.1% against B.1.351 in particular [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2103055].
Additionally, an analysis of a booster dose of NVX-CoV2373 administered six months after the primary series revealed a significant increase in neutralizing activity against VOC including Delta and Omicron [@doi:10.1101/2021.12.23.21267374].
It has also been reported that Novavax initiated booster trials in the U.K. [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].

Because the Covifenz results became available relatively recently (May 2022), limited data is available since the publication of phase III trial results [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2201300].
However, it should be noted that the Covifenz trials were conducted in 2021, at a time during which the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants were predominant [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2201300].
Genomic analysis of 122 out of 176 cases (165 in the per-protocol population) revealed that none of the COVID-19 cases reported were caused by the original Wuhan strain.
Instead, 45.9% of cases were identified as the Delta variant, 43.4% as Gamma, 4.9% as Alpha, and 5.8% as VOIs.
Therefore, the efficacy data from this phase III trial may be lower than it would have been if the trial had occurred earlier in the course of SARS-CoV-2's evolution given that the S glycoprotein expressed in the VLPs was isolated from a 2020 sample of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2201300].

### Global Vaccine Status and Distribution

The unprecedented deployment of COVID-19 vaccines in under a year from the identification of SARS-CoV-2 led to a new challenge: the formation of rapid global vaccine production and distribution plans.
The development of vaccines is costly and complicated, but vaccine distribution can be just as challenging.
Logistical considerations such as transport, storage, equipment (e.g., syringes), the workforce to administer the vaccines, and a continual supply from the manufacturers to meet global demands all must be accounted for and vary globally due to economic, geographic, and sociopolitical reasons [@doi:10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100674; @doi:10.1126/science.abe2803; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.abf1374].
As of {{owid_worldwide_date}}, at least {{owid_worldwide_total_vaccinations}} vaccine doses had been administered in at least {{owid_total_countries}} countries worldwide using {{owid_vaccine_counts}} different vaccines [@url:https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus].>
The daily global vaccination rate at this time was {{owid_worldwide_daily_rate}}.

However, the distribution of these doses is not uniform around the globe.
Latin America leads world vaccination rates with at least 82% of individuals in this region receiving one vaccine dose followed by the U.S. and Canada (81%), Asia-Pacific (81%), Europe (70%), the Middle East (58%), followed by Africa with only 33% by November 2022 [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html].
It is estimated that only ~25% of individuals in low- and middle-income countries have received one vaccine dose [@url:https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations; @doi:10.1038/s41562-021-01122-8].
Vaccine production and distribution varies from region to region and seems to depend on the availability of the vaccines and potentially a country's resources and wealth [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/business/coronavirus-vaccines-global-economy.html].

One effort to reduce these disparities is the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, a multilateral initiative as part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator coordinated by the WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the latter two of which are supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Their intention is to accelerate the development of COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics and to ensure the equitable distribution of vaccines to low- and middle-income countries [@doi:10.1111/1468-0009.12503; @url:https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/fair-allocation-mechanism-for-covid-19-vaccines-through-the-covax-facility].
COVAX invested in several vaccine programs to ensure they would have access to successful vaccine candidates [@doi:10.1126/science.369.6503.489].
However, the initiative has been less successful than was initially hoped due to less participation from high-income countries than was required for COVAX to meet its goals [@doi:10/h7kz].

Additionally, the vaccine technologies available differ widely around the globe.
As we review elsewhere [@individual-vaccines-novel], wealthier nations have invested heavily in mRNA and DNA vaccines.
In contrast, as we describe above, many countries outside of Europe and North America have developed highly effective vaccines using more traditional approaches.
As a result, there is a clear relationship between a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and its access to vaccines (Figure @fig:gdpscatter).

<!-- Figure is not rendering -->

When vaccines first became available, the wealthy nations of North America and Europe secured most of the limited COVID-19 vaccine stocks [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/us/coronavirus-vaccine-doses-reserved.html].
Throughout 2021, low- and middle-income countries faced steep competition with high-income countries for vaccines, and the rates of vaccination reflected this unequal distribution [@doi:10.1002/hpm.3341].
While the wealthiest countries in these regions could compete with each other for vaccines independent of programs such as COVAX [@doi:10.1002/hpm.3341], other countries in these regions have faced challenges in acquiring vaccines developed by the world's wealthiest nations.
Fortunately, while mRNA and DNA vaccine development programs are not widespread, vaccine development using whole-virus and subunit technologies has been undertaken worldwide.
China and India, in particular, have developed several vaccines that are now widely available in these densely populated countries (see online Appendix [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/covid19-review]).

Still, many nations, especially in Africa, are reliant on the COVAX Facility, who have promised 600 million doses to the continent [@url:https://www.bbc.com/news/56100076].
The COVAX plan seeks to ensure that all participating countries would be allocated vaccines in proportion to their population sizes.
Once each country has received vaccine doses to account for 20% of their population, the country’s risk profile will determine its place in subsequent phases of vaccine distribution.
However, several limitations of this framework exist, including that the COVAX scheme seems to go against the WHO’s own ethical principles of human well-being, equal respect, and global equity and that other frameworks might have been more suitable [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m4853].
Furthermore, COVAX is supposed to allow poorer countries access to affordable vaccines, but the vaccines are driven by publicly traded companies that are required to make a profit [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/business/coronavirus-vaccines-global-economy.html].

In any case, COVAX provides access to COVID-19 vaccines that may otherwise have been difficult for some countries to obtain.
COVAX aimed to distribute 2 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021 [@url:https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax].
According to Gavi, as of January 2022, COVAX had distributed over 1 billion vaccines to 144 participants of the program [@url:https://www.gavi.org/covax-vaccine-roll-out], short of its target but still a major global achievement.
It is envisaged that COVAX may also receive additional donations of doses from Western nations who purchased surplus vaccines in the race to vaccinate their populations, which will be a welcome boost to the vaccination programs of low- and middle-income countries [@doi:10.1126/science.abh4476].

In general, deciding on the prioritization and allocation of the COVID-19 vaccines is also a challenging task due to ethical and operational considerations.
Various frameworks, models, and methods have been proposed to tackle these issues with many countries, regions, or U.S. states devising their own distribution and administration plans [@doi:10.1126/science.abe6959; @doi:10.1038/s41598-020-78447-3; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.059; @doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-107036; @doi:10.1101/2021.01.12.21249694].
The majority of the distribution plans prioritized offering vaccines to key workers such as health care workers and those who are clinically vulnerable, such as the elderly, the immunocompromised, and individuals with comorbidities, before targeting the rest of the population, who are less likely to experience severe outcomes from COVID-19 [@url:https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccination-policy].
The availability of vaccines developed in a variety of countries using a variety of platforms is likely to work in favor of worldwide vaccine access.
The initiative by Texas Children’s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine to develop Corbevax, a patent-free COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine, is an important step towards vaccine equity because the manufacturing specifications can be shared globally.
Corbevax can be produced at low cost using existing techonology and is now licensed to Biological E. Limited (BioE), an Indian company specializing in low-cost vaccine production [@url:https://theconversation.com/corbevax-a-new-patent-free-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-a-pandemic-game-changer-globally-174672].
The vaccine has been approved for distribution in India and Botswana [@url:https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/54].

Logistical challenges and geographical barriers also dictate the availability of certain vaccines. 
Many countries have had poor availability of ultra-low temperature freezers, leading to challenges of distribution for vaccines such as mRNA vaccines that require storage at very low temperatures [@doi:10.1093/inthealth/ihab010; @doi:10.1208/s12249-021-01974-3; @url:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-03/pfizer-to-supply-african-health-care-workers-with-vaccines]. 
Furthermore, ancillary supplies such as vaccine containers, diluents for frozen or lyophilized vaccines, disinfecting wipes, bandaids, needles, syringes, sharps and biological waste disposal containers are also required, which may not be readily available in geographically isolated loactions and can be bulky and expensive to ship [@doi:10.1093/inthealth/ihab010]. 
While some of these challenges in vaccine rollout in low- and middle-income countries are being addressed through COVAX [@url:https://www.unicef.org/supply/covax-ensuring-global-equitable-access-covid-19-vaccines], many issues persist worldwide [@doi:10/jqp4; @doi:10.1093/cid/ciac361; @doi:10.1080/20477724.2022.2091862].
COVAX also failed to distribute its promised two billion vaccine doses on time due to multiple complications [@url:https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/12/10/covax-doses-delivered].

Another major challenge to global vaccine distribution is vaccine hesitancy, which the WHO has designated as a leading global health threat [@url:https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019]. 
Polling in the U.S. in January 2021 suggested that 20% of individuals were reluctant to receive a vaccine at that time, with a further 31% expressing some hesitancy to a lesser extent [@url:kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-january-2021-vaccine-hesitancy; @doi:10.1056/NEJMms2101220].
A survey of 8,243 long-term healthcare workers in November 2020 (Indiana, USA) reported that only 69% of respondents would ever consider receiving an FDA-approved vaccine due to their perceived risk of side effects (70%), health concerns (34%), efficacy (20%), and religious beliefs (12%) [@doi:10.1111/jgs.17022].
Notably, almost a third of parents surveyed in the United States in March 2021 expressed concerns about vaccinating their children against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1177/003335492211143].
Indeed, vaccine hesitancy has been reported as a significant barrier to vaccine distribution in countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa [@doi:10.1002/jmv.28156; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.abm9825; @doi:10.1186/s41256-022-00255-1; @doi:10.1080/20477724.2021.2011580; @doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052432]. 
Various factors have been associated with increased vaccine hesitancy including access to compelling misinformation via social media [@doi:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac207; @doi:10.1038/s41591-022-01728-z], religious and conservative polictical beliefs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0268926; @doi:10.1093/pubmed/fdab122; @doi:10.1177/1075547020960463; @doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02254], and safety and efficacy concerns [@doi:10.1177/003335492211143], to highlight a few.
Many of the concerns regarding safety and efficacy have focused on the novel mRNA technologies due to the perceived speed of their development and expedited clinical trial process [@doi:10.1186/s13037-021-00291-9]; however, general vaccine hesitancy relating to traditional vaccine platforms existed long before the pandemic and the distribution of the novel mRNA vaccines [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.09.035; @doi:10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.09.006].

### Conclusions

Much attention has focused on the most novel vaccine technologies that have been deployed against SARS-CoV-2, but the established vaccine platforms discussed here have all made a significant impact on human health during the twentieth century and in some cases even earlier.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated new potential in these established technologies.
In the early 2000s, these technologies were explored for managing SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.3201/eid1107.050219; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro3143], but the epidemic was controlled before those efforts came to fruition [@doi:10.1056/nejmp2005630].
Similarly, these technologies were explored for MERS-CoV, but outbreaks were sporadic and difficult to predict, making vaccine testing and the development of a vaccination strategy difficult [@doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1358325].
However, in the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these technologies have been used to accelerate vaccine development programs worldwide.
Therefore, they are also offering the opportunity to respond quickly to an emergent pathogen.

While these tried-and-true technologies don't always produce vaccines with the highly desirable VE reported in mRNA clinical trials (which exceeded 90%), the efficacies are still very high, and these vaccines are extremely effective at preventing severe illness and death.
As a result, the greater accessibility and stability of these vaccines makes them extremely valuable for the global effort to mitigate the loss of life from SARS-CoV-2.
